      <h4>The Next Paradigm? </h4>
      <p> <b>If we've had functional prosthetics, logical and informational prosthetics, 
        then the next phase of development conceivable is symbolic prosthetics</b>. 
        That is, as the computer imitates the logic functions of the mind to the 
        benefit of the symbolic function, so <b>the symbolic prosthetic (neurator?) 
        would imitate the symbolic manipulations of the mind to the benefit of 
        the `parasymbolic' functions of self.</b>

      <h4> Growing rather than Making. </h4>
      <p> The practical attempts at construction of such an instrument are taking 
        place; on the one hand `neural networks' endeavour to link computers in 
        complex nets that can process input in massively parallel ways, on the 
        other hand some people are working on letting a simple computer intelligence 
        evolve into a higher intelligence. <b>The reliance on the logical binary 
        nature of the computer is probably an impediment to this goal; it's possible 
        that such a thing might evolve from chemical/biological means - this may 
        be the first prosthetic that we have to grow rather than make.</b>

      <h4> Towards the Spiritual Realm? </h4>
      <p> What's certain is that a symbolic prosthetic could allow us to see patterns 
        of another dimension again beyond Chaos; perhaps they would allow us to 
        see `paranormal' or spiritual experience in a different way?
