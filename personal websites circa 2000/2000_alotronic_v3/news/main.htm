<p><b>December 2000<br>
  &nbsp;Deviations in performance at La Mama</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>At last the play goes on... I recently went to Canberra to workshop the play 
    with Elbow Theatre and had a great time. Iain is a very good director, the 
    cast were right into the play and the script was holding together nicely. 
    The performance dates:</p>
  <p>Canberra: 23-25 November at the Corrong Theatre<br>
    Melbourne: 29 Nov - 16 Dec at La Mama</p>

<p><b>November 2000<br>
  &nbsp;Yet another job!</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A ten month contract at Swinburne University in the Learning and Teaching 
    Services dept. Good money, quite technical. I'm going to save a lot of money 
    and figure out what to do with my life. Well I know what to do with my life 
    (write plays!) but tying that in with the cash is a tricky business...</p>

  &nbsp;'a thread' wins Country Road cyberwriting competition</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, the ironies... Never having brought a stitch from 
    Country Road in my life, now I have to find $500 worth of clothes! Yes, I 
    wrote a small work which will soon be hosted on the Country Road Australia 
    site. Also won a brand spanking new HP Pavillion (700 mghz PIII, 15 G ultra 
    ATA, fancy 133 mghz bus, and a CDRW) as well as a new printer and scanner. 
    Nice work!</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>August 2000:<br>
  &nbsp;Yet another new site design...</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I've changed it all again! Identical content, 
    different flavour. I decided the other one was too gloomy, and I also wanted 
    to put some more of my own photography in it. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I was going to do the whole thing in flash, but decided 
    that I'll put the flash effort into a web trailer for 'deviations', so there's 
    just this html version for the time being. Also there's just a touch of database 
    activity in the background - I'm starting to get my head around cold fusion 
    (a web server application).</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>July 2000:<br>
  &nbsp;Allen gets a real job </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Sick pay, paid holidays... That's all new for me! Yes, 
    VUT have decided it was a good idea to get me in on a .6 contract. Seems like 
    a good idea since I was doing @ 20 hrs a week here and there anyway. I'll 
    be doing more or less exactly the same in the terms and 'other things' over 
    the summer.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>July 2000:<br>
  &nbsp;Deviations dates and venues finalised</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Hope you can make it along... I'm making a flash trailer 
    for this one.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">At the Corrong in Canberra:</font> <font color="#FFFFFF">Mid 
    November</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFFFF">At Lama in Melbourne: 26th November to 16th December</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Someone desribed the Corrong as the LaMama of Canberra. 
    Someone else once described LaMama as the Bats of Melbourne, so that must 
    make Bats the Corrong of Wellington??</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>&nbsp;March 2000: <br>
  &nbsp; Allen wins Swinburne Uni Postgraduate Award</b></font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, someone thought the casino project was the best 
    thing that happened in postgrad coursework at Swinburne in 1998. And they 
    gave me some money too, which was nice!</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Much respect to Lisa and Fran for getting me interested 
    and providing encouragement along the way...</font></p>

<p tabindex="2"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>&nbsp;February 2000: <br>
  &nbsp; 'Deviations' to be developed by Elbow Theatre </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Elbow Theatre recently applied for some development 
    money to spend a couple of weeks going through my new stage play 'Deviations' 
    with me, and were successful. Sometime later in the year I will go up to Canberra 
    and spend two weeks with them on the script. At the conclusion of the workshop 
    period there will be a staged reading (a requiremnt of the grant) and hopefully 
    they will feel inspired enough to mount a production. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Elbow Theatre was started by Ian Sinclair and Ken Spiteri 
    in 1998, and has done productions in Melbourne, Canberra and a Seson at B 
    Sharp in Sydney. Ian has also worked in the UK, and tutors at Aust National 
    University as well as directing. Ken is a friend of my good friend Stephen 
    Bain - they met in Paris doing a course with Enrique Pardau...</font></p>

<p tabindex="3"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>&nbsp;January 2000: <br>
  &nbsp; Allen escapes corporate world to teach and write </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">After a satisfying and productive six months with SAI, 
    I've moved back from the brink of corporate respectability. Now I'm teaching 
    again (sessional al VUT tafe and Swinburne Uni) in Electronic Design and Interactive 
    Media - which just means web publishing. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">My goal is now to complete a few drafts of some plays 
    I have hanging around and do some of my own web projects and freelance work.<br>
