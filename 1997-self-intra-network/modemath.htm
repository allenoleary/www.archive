      Use of Models.</b> 
      <p>
      Models are very useful things, allowing us to visualise larger structures
      in miniature. Of course it's very important to choose an appropriate model
      and be exact about it's conditions of use and acknowledge it's limits; <b>any
      model chosen carries with it both the bias of the modeller and that of the
      user.</b>I would even go so far as to say that the history of philosophy
      and thought could be modelled through a model of models... <b>Really exciting
      models, or at least those in my eyes, are those which acknowledge their own
      limits, but also sit on the edges of falling apart.</b> De Landa is interesting
      because each of the models he provides transforms into another, it doesn't
      lose usefulness, but fails to make the phase shift, and is so always stranded
      in it's own domain, it's own basin of attraction. It's the bit in between
      the domains of models that holds charge.

    <td><b>Another modelling system, just for the hell of it...</b>
      <p>
      Too late to be included in the body of this work, I started reading another
      models book <b>`Mind Tools, the five different levels of Mathematical
      Reality'.</b> Just for the hell of it, I will summarise it very briefly.
      His modelling is less useful for this current essay because it is about Math
      and not Machine paradigms, but since the two are somewhat connected, I thought
      it would make an interesting diversion...

      1. <b>Number.</b> This corresponds to dealing with points on a line, the
      line being that of real numbers. An examination of the archetypes of small
      numbers and Phythagorian principles, as well as numerology, shows how common
      and ancient this way of dealing with the world is. <b>Number is Digital is

      then increasingly complex systems - quadratics, conics, polynomials,et al.
      Space is the study of the smooth:<b> Space is analog is `How much?' is

      3. <b>Logic.</b> The first order of thought that links number and space.
      By letting a symbol stand in for a complex reality, logic allows the use
      of new languages like algebra, and the elaborate assemblage of mathematical
      theories.<b> Logic is digital is synthetic.</b></td>

      4. <b>Infinity.</b> Also connects number and space by breaking space into
      infinitely many distinct points; ie between 0 and 1 is an infinite number
      of possible fractions. The language of infinity is calculus; differentiation
      and integration provide ways of thinking of a curve as an infinite staircase
      of points. While infinity is complementary to logic, it also passes beyond
      it. Godel proved that no finite logical system can provide all the facts
      about an infinite set of natural numbers. <b>Infinity is analog is
      analytical.</b></td>

      5. <b>Information.</b> Because this is a current phase shift concept, information 
      is harder to define. An number of information theories exist, the earliest 
      being Information Theory, realised by Shannon at Bell labs in the 1940's. 
      He was the formulator of the idea data `bits'. Moving beyond this we get 
      theories like Cybernetics, AI, neural networks. In general information rests 
      in three concepts; information length (and the study of how much information 
      can be represented by less information; ie compression), complexity and 
      understanding. <b>Information can integrate all the four modes above, and 
      communicate between them openly.</b> Viewed in this way information is comprehensive 
      is translation, is communication. </td>

      <b>1. Middle Ages.</b> Written language provides the means to label things,
      and scholarship concentrates on accumulating lists and cases. <b>Simple numbers
      were used as a part of the process of labelling, and corresponds to the belief
      that the world was a `stack' of principles and orders.</b></td>

      <b>2. Renaissance.</b> With the rise of perspective, space becomes manipulable
      by math. <b>World view changes to become a set of objects in space, rather
      than names in God's mind. </b>Things came to be viewed as spatially oriented;
      Galileo asserts that the space that planets are in in fundementally the same
      space that people occupy. The distribution of printed books also has subtle
      effects; the act of reading induces people into using an enriched imaginary
      space.</td>

      <b>3. Industrial Revolution. The advent of the machine sees things viewed
      as logical processes.</b> Newtons `Principia' is a logical system, a search
      to provide a set of universal laws to describe the world's machinic nature.
      Economics follows a model of the society as a large machine. Boole defines
      a symbolic logic. (This is where De Landa starts, with the clockwork mechanism,
      a predetermined logical series giving rise to a certain effect).</td>

      <b>4. Modernity.</b> Limits are seen to press in around people. A generalised
      alienation occurs, arising from a realisation of the worlds' unaffectable
      infinity. There is a profound questioning of the rational, and, with evidence
      from the study of infinity structures, it is realised that logic has a limit.
      Set theory arises as the study of the infinite, while confusions at the
      sub-atomic level of science undermines absolutism. Einsteins theory of the
      changing nature of energy, mass and speed is appropriately called `The Theory
      of Relativity'. <b>In essence, it becomes realised that no complete description
      of the world can be made,</b> and this is borne out in Godels work.</td>

      and physical systems begin to be seen as informational processors.</b> The 
      notion of information as an absolute good (`information wants to be free') 
      leads to a growing pluralism and to an extent offsets the alienation of

      Clearly there are parallels between Ruckers ideas and those of De Landa.
      It's beyond the scope of this essay to look further into this, but both views
      share a paradigmatic construct. The bulk of this essay looks at something
      beyond Ruckers Math-centric analysis, however, and pushes into the combination
      of an informatics with identity.</td>
