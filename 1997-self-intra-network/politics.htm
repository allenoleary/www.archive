      <b>A New Politics?</b> 
      <p> Just as previously technically mediated epochs had specific politics, 
        so the network has modes which are more active and critical, and those 
        which are passive. If the labour mechanism of the Industrial Revolution 
        gave rise to Union politics, what activity does the network imply?

    <th align="left"><b>Singular Identity equals the oppression of the State.</b> 
      <p> The creation of a singular identity is the prime act of political suppression 
        in the `post-industrial' epoch: The precision of locating a subjects whereabouts 
        in the actual/virtual world is the primary means where the state enforces 
        itself. </p>
      <p> We are quite accustomed to having to release details about ourselves 
        to government agencies, but this is a historical development. The underlying 
        premise is expressed in the Panopticon <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;that 
        socially engineered device that relies on the prisoners paranoia that. 
        at any time, they may be being examined. Foucault <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;outlines 
        the development of this self-regulating mechanism, and would no doubt 
        be bringing our attention to the rash of `security' cameras that are hitting 
        the developed world; <b>surveillance, no matter how apparently benign, 
        always represses the space under examination</b>.

      <p> <b>The effort to create `BUGS' (Body Units Grounded in Self <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;) 
        is the prime political act of post-industrial society. It's an effort 
        to maintain a zero-state, that is a `paradise' with no deviance.</b> In 
        Australia, the recent drive to limit immigration is a classic drive to 
        keep the socius `clean'. The irony is that <b>a zero state needs outside 
        energy to keep it going, and must open itself to the outside in order 
        to gain energy to keep its wheels turning</b>. The classic instance in 
        this century is Nazi Germany; to create a paradise, the outside energies 
        had to be appropriated and war in some form is a required action of any 
        state that is going to try to make an ideal world.

      <p> A similar mechanism exists in the developed worlds relationship to the 
        third world. <b>The developed world could not exist without an undeveloped 
        outside from which it derives it's energy to keep going.</b> For America, 
        for instance, state-expanding warfare is not necessary, since the expansionist 
        drive of it's IT, Film, Financial (etc etc) industries is enough to keep 
        enough energy coming into the system, at least for the time being. Despite 
        the USA's rhetorics, outsiders will always be mustered and exploited, 
        whether they exist inside or outside the geographical borders or the country.

    <th align="left"><b>BUGS on the Internet.</b> 
      <p> <b>It's hugely ironic that the Internet arose within the military/academic 
        establishment, given that it's effect is to undermine the whole BUGS effort.</b> 
        BUGS drives to ensure that any persona has the warranty of a body attached, 
        and can therefore be tracked, and charged (whether for money or offences). 
        The internet allows techniques for persona that encourage slippage, strange 
        becomings and experimental selves; Avatars, aliases, MUDS, anonymous FTP, 
        hacking and cracking, e-mail, web-publishing can all work either for or 
        against BUGS and the agencies of control. 
      <p> <b>The Internet innately resists efforts to regulate it and turn its 
        users into BUGS, despite the best efforts of Government agencies; </b>the 
        Clipper Chip, Back-Doors in Encryption, efforts to give sites CPI ratings, 
        making ISPs responsible for content, these are all very naive efforts 
        to pin down a medium that was designed to maintain operability and secrecy 
        in the first place. For Business, the challenge is not&nbsp;so much&nbsp;to 
        legislate, but to&nbsp;overwhelm&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19"
	  border="0" align="top"> and the effort going into enforce BUGS &nbsp;in 
        the form of financial transactions is huge.

    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#f5e7c2" align="left" width="200"><font size="-1">Business 
      is hyping the `enlargement' of the Net to link consumer devices. This will 
      enable them to re-route services though `chargeable' means (cable and HDTV) 
      and therefore back to BUGS. Perhaps even&nbsp;more important, usage information 
      can then be used for marketing - they will be able to collect information 
      as easily as they send it.</font></td>

    <th align="left"><b>Self and Politic</b>. 
      <p> <b>In this sense, anyone engaged in persona play on the Internet is 
        engaged in a political act, that of resisting the effort to flatten society 
        and it's subjects.</b> Of course someone who is `of the system' in the 
        real world is less likely to see the Net in this way, and indeed it's 
        possible to use the net without opposing BUGS in any way. 
      <p> For those who are aware (and now, I'm afraid, that includes you) the 
        Internet is an important field of `becoming other' or, more specifically, 
        `becoming virtual'. <b>There are, just like the subject who is striving 
        for personal anarchy, dangers in becoming virtual. The first is that, 
        in placing more of yourself `on' the net you abandon the real world, and 
        leave it open for zero-state manipulations. The second is that while on 
        the net you merely reproduce the status-quo;</b> claims from men, for 
        instance, that they can understand how women feel after taking on a female 
        persona are deeply offensive and merely sexualise and reinforce gender 
        difference and their inequalities. 
      <p> It would be more honest to say that they understood something of the 
        way that gender difference in Persona is created and arbitrary, and be 
        open to the possibility that such arbitrary constructions bring into question 
        their own assumptions about gender (and their own erotics). Such awareness 
        seems to be rare; it would mean, in this instance, admitting that a homoerotic 
        force was coming into play. Heaven Forbid! <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">

    <th align="left"><b>Erasing the Actual/Virtual difference.</b> 
      <p> With a Networked Persona, effects and experiences on the Net reflect 
        back into the material self as if they had happened in the material. This 
        means that your <b>Net personas are equal in effect to your `actual' personas 
        and vice-versa, there is no difference.</b> Therefore it's no big surprise 
        that the Internet is the site of some of the most important cultural fights 
        going on at the moment. It's also no surprise that any `net-consensus' 
        gathers around what we can call `first amendment' issues; freedom of speech, 
        assembly and ideas.
