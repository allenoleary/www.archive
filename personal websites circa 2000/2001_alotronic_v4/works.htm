  <p class="h5">Works</p>
  <p> Here's a bag of stuff; flash projects, hypertext fiction, plays, radio plays 
    and even an essay. Decided to lump it all together because I don't see much 
    difference between doing a flash thing and writing a play - the creative process 
    isn't wildly different, and a theatre is as much a technlogy as the internet...</p>
  <p>For commercial/freelance stuff, see my resume.</p>

  <h5>Fond Love and Kisses [stageplay for Downstage]</h5>
  <p><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_flakgif.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left">This 
    one is going on September 2002. It's a play set against the 'furlough draft' 
    incident in NZ during WWII. It mainly concerns two brothers, Will and Henry, 
    and Will's financee, Fiona. There's a lot of shit goes down when soldiers 
    return home for a rest and then one of them decides not to go back... I've 
    developed quite a liquid style for this one to avoid boring WWII play syndrome!</p>

  <h5>Alotronic System Hex [flash toy]</h5>
  <p><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_syshex.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left" usemap="#Map9" border="0"><map name="Map9"><area shape="rect" coords="83,73,94,83" href="../sustemhex/index.htm" alt="view system hex" title="view system hex" target="_blank"></map>Just 
    playing with the idea of replicating a 'desktop' in flash, and making it a 
    little quirky and funny. Particulary interested in testing 'swapDepths' and 
    having a laugh. Not finished, but you can see how it's going anyway.</p>

  <br>
  <h5>Hot Wheels [feature film]</h5>
  <p><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_nada.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left">Everyone's 
    got one film in them right? Well I hope to have a lot more than that, so this 
    is one I'm as training. Can't say what it's about, but it's a little wicked...</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <h5>The Casanova Complex [interactive database art]</h5>
  <p><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_casanova.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left">This 
    one is hard work: making an online database system that alows users to enter 
    words, then have those words compete with previous entries for a place in 
    the final sentence. Casanova takes over every now and then and 'seduces' the 
    database with his smooth talk!</p>

  <h5>Ride on Time [radio play] broadcast RNZ July 2001</h5>
  <div><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_nada.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left"></div>
  <p>This is a play I actually wrote in 1995. It's a comedy about the oldest cycle-courier 
    in Wellington and his quest to get some sperm across town on a hot day for 
    a client. Produced and directed by Stephen Danby, cast included Sean Allen, 
    Dra McKay, Kevin Blackburn, Carmel Maglone, Madelaine Mac Namarra, Tim Bartlett 
    and a few thousand others. </p>

    built this as a personal project to help the NZ theatre scene get connected. 
    It's a fully functioning coldFusion database driven site that works. Only 
    problem is I haven't got around to launching it yet!</p>

  <h5>Where in the World is Brian? [flash project] Feb 2001</h5>
  <div><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_nada.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left"></div>
  <p>This one tracks the whereabout's of my intrepid Dad. He likes sailing and 
    does delivery trips, too-ing and fro-ing around the world, preferably near 
    the equator. Also doubles as an email repository.</p>

  <h5>Materials and Processes [flash educational interactive] Jan 2001</h5>
  <p><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_engineering.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left" usemap="#Map2" border="0"><map name="Map2"><area shape="rect" coords="83,74,93,84" href="../engineering/index.htm" target="_blank" alt="view" title="view"></map>I 
    did this one [of 6 similar] while at Swinburne Uni. It's the best flashing 
    I've done yet on a technical level. Unforetunately the design sucks - and 
    I didn't do it! But it has full drag'n'drop, dynammic feedback and the graphing 
    tool is magic.</p>

  <h5>Deviations [stage play @ lamama] Dec 2000</h5>
  <p><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_deviations_flyer.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left">'Elbow 
    Productions' of Canberra got developemnt money and staged this one in Canberra 
    at the Currong and at LaMama in Melbourne. I had a ball, as I spent a lot 
    of time with the director [Iain Sinclair, a RADA grad] as well as the lovely 
    cast [Lenore, Pip, Micheal and Lucy]. </p>
  <p>Here's some reviews to read. See below for trailer...</p>

  </div>
  <p>This is a flash site for the Melbourne Production of my play 'deviations'. 
    Well worth a look, particularly for the interactive 'test your deviance' section.

  </div>
  <p>Ah, the ironies... Never having brought a stitch from Country Road in my 
    life, I won the Country Road Cyberwriting competition with this short hyperfiction. 
    Won a brand spanking new HP Pavillion as well as a new printer and scanner. 
    And a $500 gift voucher. The work itself is three slices from a relationship.</p>

    this for a very dull University course - tried to sex-up the front end. The 
    project fell through after I made this, but I still like it.</p>

  <h5>The Casino Project [hyperfiction] 1998-2000</h5>
  <p><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_casino.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left" usemap="#Map6" border="0"><map name="Map6"><area shape="rect" coords="84,73,94,84" href="../casino/index.htm" alt="view casino project" title="view casino project" target="_blank"></map>I 
    won the Swinburne Postgraduate Coursework Award with this one. A love stpry 
    set in the (then new) melbourne Casino. The imaging is fairly primitive (I 
    had never even opened a paint program before this!) but the ideas and structure 
    is still satisfying, particularly the 'shopping' section. </p>

  <h5>Self Intra Network [hyperessay] 1997</h5>
  <p><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_sin.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left" usemap="#Map7" border="0"><map name="Map7"><area shape="rect" coords="83,73,93,84" href="../sin/index.htm" alt="view SIN" title="view SIN" target="_blank"></map>My 
    first web work. This kinda grew from a class project into something fairly 
    substantial. Again, the design is quite primitive, but the structure and the 
    writing still hold up very well. It's about the formation of identity in the 
    age of the network. 7 </p>

    music by Janet Rodderick, and with a cast including Peter Hambleton, Clare 
    Wladron, Sean Allen, Jacob Rajan, Nicola Murphy and Malcom Murray.</p>
  <p>This play was also on the English curriculum for that year at Victoria University.</p>

  <h5>'Weightless' [radio play broadcast by Radio NZ] 1994</h5>
  <p><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_weightless.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left">Directed 
    by Carol Dee and with Jonathan Hendry and Bronwyn Bardley in the cast, 'Weightless' 
    is about a couple of flatmates who try to write a film together. The film, 
    about a fishing viallge on the Wairarapa coast, starts as a serious piece, 
    but the conflicting ideas of the flatmates soon see it denegrate into a shoddy 
    thriller.</p>

  <h5>Taking a Bath [short film Wellington and Auckland film festivals + 'Eat 
    Carpet' SBS Aus] 1994</h5>
  <div><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_nada.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left"></div>
  <p>Written by Stephen Bain and myself. Murray Lynch got some money out of the 
    QEII arts council to make this short film. Stephen and I took the main roles 
    (since we wrote them for ourselves!) and Nancy Brunning took the role of Flic, 
    the explosive girlfriend. </p>

  <div><img src="gfx_gallery/v4_nada.gif" width="99" height="87" align="left"></div>
  <p>Stephen Bain, Merophie Carr and myself wrote and produced this play at Bats 
    and later took it for a ride to Hamilton (Merophie's hometown). It is about 
    a heartless game show host who falls in love with the ghost of Vivien Leigh, 
    and starts to lose the plot.<br>
