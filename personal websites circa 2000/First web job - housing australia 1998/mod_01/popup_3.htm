        Restructuring</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All advanced capitalist 
        countries are going through a process of industrial restructuring, in 
        order to achieve greater international competitiveness among themselves 
        and with the emergent Asian nations. This is creating outcomes of considerable 
        importance for housing and housing policy. A review of the major literature 
        on industrial restructuring and an analysis of empirical trends over the 
        last decade would indicate two important outcomes: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Relatively higher 
          levels of unemployment for longer time periods, compared to earlier 
          decades of the postwar era; and,</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Substantial increases 
          in casual labour, both because of the need for a more flexible workforce 
          and because a number of the growth industries (for example, services 
          and tourism) are characterised by a dependence on casual labour. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Both outcomes suggest 
        that a substantial minority of households in most countries will be on 
        very low to low incomes, with important implications for housing need 
        and demand. Unless there are significant income support programs to top 
        up low labour market incomes, signs point to considerably larger numbers 
        in the 21st century who will be unable to afford private market provided 
        housing as we know it. This may produce new private initiatives to keep 
        housing affordable (for example, more multi-unit housing), new forms of 
        adaptive behaviour by lower income households (for example, shared living 
        arrangements) or new forms of housing assistance. </font></p>
