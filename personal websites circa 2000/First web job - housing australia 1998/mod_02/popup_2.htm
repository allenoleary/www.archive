        2. Home Ownership in Australia</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>2&#9;A Natural 
        Tenure?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A second argument 
        is that home ownership is somehow a natural tenure form, reflecting an 
        innate desire of people to own, as well as recognition that it is an innately 
        superior tenure. The above data also, in part, invalidates this argument. 
        If home ownership were natural, then all countries would gravitate to 
        it as income rose. Poverty, in this context, is seen as the factor which 
        blocks people’s natural inclination to ownership. The more important argument, 
        as expressed by Kemeny (1983), is that there is nothing innately superior 
        in home ownership. It only takes on that appearance in the context of 
        the financial and legal support available for this tenure relative to 
        others. Thus, what are the perceived attractions of home ownership that 
        could make it the <i>natural</i> choice of households?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Most people are attracted 
        to ownership because it is secure (<i>a home of your own</i>, offering 
        freedom to renovate and decorate), is cheaper over a lifetime, and is 
        an investment. In Australia most would agree that only ownership offers 
        these characteristics. But in some countries, residential tenancy legislation 
        allows the tenant security for life and, indeed, allows for a rental property 
        to be passed on to children. Similar legislation offers tenants the right 
        to renovate and decorate. In many countries, a different set of financial 
        structures and subsidies means that ownership is often more expensive 
        than other tenure types. Further, the decline in new housing demand as 
        the population ages and the reduction in subsidies for ownership have 
        removed the tendency for house price inflation and capital gain. In many 
        European countries, particularly the United Kingdom, home ownership has 
        become a financial millstone for households who have mortgages in excess 
        of the worth of their property. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This is not to undermine 
        the importance of home ownership, but simply to point out that its success 
        is dependent on the institutional context. Australia has, for various 
        reasons, always had a context which is conducive to ownership.</font></p>
