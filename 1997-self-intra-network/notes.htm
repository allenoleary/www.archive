      Introduction.</b> 
      <p> This hyper-essay from the end of `96 is a response to a tutor who said 
        `Go for the passion...' and wanted a 2.5k essay - I don't think it's possible 
        to be passionate in that few words, so I ignored the&nbsp;limit... sorry 
        David. This was also my first experience with html and hypertext. 
      <p> The paper I was doing was `Textuality and Discourse' within a Graduate 
        Diploma in Writing at&nbsp;Swinburne Uni (Melbourne Aust) It turned out 
        to be a front for a course that was really about writing &amp; the net, 
        though we did get stuff about the history of the text/book thing. 
      <p> Our tutor was pretty much pro-virt, and a lot of the reading we were 
        doing seemed the same - I knew there had to be a problem in there somewhere... 
      <p> So I found one...

      <b>The Hyper Writing Process</b> <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top"> 
      <p> Having zero experience in HTML and related issues, <b>I blithely thought 
        a `hyper-essay' would be a quick bit of fun</b>. I have come across the 
        following challenges quite apart from actually writing all the material 
        itself... 
      <p> <b>Writing without an outline.</b> 
      <p> Starting with a mind-map, <b>I quickly sketched in all the nodes without 
        worrying initially about how I was going to connect them</b>. I trusted 
        that nodes were relevant merely because they were occurring to me. I chose 
        this way to write because I believe that <b>a certain process will give 
        you a certain product</b>. If I had started with a linear essay and broken 
        it up I would be committing a primal sin of hyper-media; that is, dressing 
        up an old form in a new <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top"> 
      <p> <b>Discovery of a linking pattern - dimensional imagination.</b> 
      <p> <b>Having written the nodes, I mapped out the links in semantic space 
        - what nodes had to be `close' to one another? Which nodes had to be right 
        down the path, and which near the beginning?</b> This design issue was 
        fascinating and time-consuming. During this process I discovered that 
        too-long deviations were taken when looking at secondary (`footnote') 
        material. The way around this was to keep notes relevant to one node only 
        `on' the node itself. For clarity, links that extended argument I keep 
        at the exit of the node, rather than in the body text of the node itself. 
        <b>This ensures that the reader has to at least scan the bold selections 
        before making their way to another page</b>. Hopefully the reader recognises 
        this consistency... 
      <p> <b>Rewriting and Editing.</b> 
      <p> <b> </b>Filling out and researching more stuff to make the nodes resonate 
        more with each other. <b>Because of the relatively wide range of ideas 
        called on, I tried to keep each node orbiting in the area of one or two 
        new concepts and explications</b>. Most nodes have one dominant thinker 
        as their reference. 
      <p> <b>Finding an articulatory and engaging structure.</b> 
      <p> <b>I wanted to find a `gate' concept that was related to the material 
        and also seductive in itself.</b> I quickly found that just clicking around 
        bits of text is dull - like much of the net itself. <b>Since the subject 
        is subject, and the subject can never wholly escape the body, I have used 
        an initial gate of an asexual fashion illustration,</b> itself prompted 
        by wanting the cursor/hand to do something other than `select'. This is 
        a weak play on `the body of the argument'. While this metaphor gets eaten 
        up a bit, I have tried to tie it strongly in to the front and back end 
        of the structure, and give it a little of a character... 
      <p> <b>Navigation.</b> 
      <p> <b>One of my major beefs with the net is that often you have to idea 
        how big a site is or how far through it you are</b> - you can't see how 
        many pages their are before you read it. While this is obviously sometimes 
        the point, I decided that, given enough time, I would include the `radar' 
        familiar to me from video games. This also gives the whole thing an implied 
        center, a notion I play with when you reach the `heart'. 
      <p> I would have explored navigation themes, maybe structuring the whole 
        thing on a spatial semantic similar to games' N/S E/W, but with different 
        terms on the axis - concrete/abstract, person/idea - but time and relevance 
        were against me, and I&nbsp;had to settle for an outline view of the pages 
        which you have to click into. 
      <p> <b>Production.</b> 
      <p> <b>Like a theatre piece, the whole thing had a performance feel to the 
        making</b>. With the `first night' in mind (the tutor&nbsp;reading it), 
        the process had a comfortable feeling to it, not unlike my days as an 
        actor or production worker in theatre. Hand-coding HTML for Ver 1.0 of 
        this essay was `interesting' but I prefer my editor now... 
      <p> <b>Summary</b> 
      <p> All in all I'm quite happy with the result of this first hyper-essay 
        experience; It all felt quite natural, the theatre thing again I think.
