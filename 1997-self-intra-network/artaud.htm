      <b>The Theatre of Cruelty (exterior version)</b> 
      <p> For the first part of his life, Artaud was very active in the French 
        Avant-Garde, founding a theatre company (Theatre Alfred Jarry) and writing 
        manifestos for a <b>`Theatre of Cruelty', where action was more important 
        than words, the action was `immediate' - that is not repeatable - and 
        should threaten the bodies and identities of the performers and spectators.</b> 
      <p> His collision with Balinese theatre stimulated him into mounting productions 
        which we would call `happenings' or `performance art'. These productions 
        had nowhere near the influence of his writings - suffering from the age-old 
        theatrical problems of lack of money and rehearsal time. 
      <p> He spent much of his later life in Asylums and underwent a major series 
        of ECT. The whys and wherefores of his life are still under debate - his 
        Catholic family wants to keeps his work suppressed, friends and intellectuals 
        criticise his treatment and Doctors, in turn, accuse his friends of keeping 
        him in a state of drug-addiction.

      The Theatre of Cruelty (Interior Version)</b> 
      <p> In the current context, <b>Artaud is most interesting in that later 
        in life he internalised his theatre onto an interior ground. Failing to 
        realise the Theatre of Cruelty in the exterior world, he creates that 
        world in himself.</b> 
      <p> This theatre found expression in journals and drawings which could easily 
        be set aside as `Art Brut', but there is something profound in the way 
        he assembles this drama where he is the `becoming cruel' of himself.and 
        achieving what Deleuze and Guattarri would call an effective `schizoanalysis' 
        (here we have to understand the difference between a schizophrenia of 
        breakdown and one of breakthrough).
