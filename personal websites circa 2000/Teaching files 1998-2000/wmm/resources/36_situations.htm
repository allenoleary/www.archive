<P><SMALL>- "In 1868, Georges Polti, after an extensive survey of 
literature,</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>declared that there were no more than 36 dramatic situations. 
Here,</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>he said, was the stuff of human drama. No matter the tale, for it 
to</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>be dramatic, it would invariably involve one of these 36 
situations.</SMALL> 
<P>
<P><SMALL>"This column is devoted to Polti's work. Provided is an 
abbreviation</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>of his book, "The Thirty-six Dramatic Situations", which is 
highly</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>recommended, if hard to find. The full manuscript lists various 
works</SMALL>
