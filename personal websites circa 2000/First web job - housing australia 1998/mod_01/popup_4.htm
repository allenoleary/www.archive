        Spatial Polarisation</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One of the unintended 
        outcomes of spatial restructuring in the interests of efficiency and competitiveness 
        is what is increasingly called <i>social and spatial polarisation</i>. 
        This term captures the notion that while the benefits of restructuring 
        may flow to many – perhaps most – households, a sizable minority will 
        be bypassed. <i>There will therefore be greater polarisation between the 
        affluent and non-affluent; in the absence of countervailing policies, 
        this will increasingly take on a spatial dimension</i>. The concern by 
        some is that the affluent will reside in certain parts of cities and in 
        certain regions, sometimes in gated and walled communities, and those 
        less well off in other increasingly resource-deprived and unsustainable 
        communities. How to create sustainable communities that minimise crime, 
        violence, welfare dependency and family breakdown will be a major housing 
        and planning challenge in coming decades. </font></p>
