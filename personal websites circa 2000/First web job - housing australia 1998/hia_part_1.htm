  guide and induction course to Australian housing is written with two audiences 
  in mind: those seeking general information about the attributes of the Australian 
  housing system; and social housing workers, particularly those in the community 
  sector, requiring more knowledge of their work context. It is provided in layers 
  so that the reader can skim or go deeper, depending upon their level of interest.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There are three objectives:</font></P>

  Housing System</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Flying into any Australian 
  city on a clear day, an international visitor is inevitably impressed by the 
  red roofed houses sitting in detached gardens for as far as the eye can see. 
  In Sydney the landscape might be cut by the bright blue of the harbour and its 
  many bays, inlets and rivers, but in other cities it is a picture of almost 
  unrelieved red and green. These sprawling cities of predominantly detached houses 
  are probably the most visible image of what is characteristic, and occasionally 
  unique, about Australian housing.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>PICTURE HERE</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Behind this image is a 
  complex housing system with many features which are different from those of 
  other countries or, even if similar, take on different dimensions. This website 
  takes us through the major characteristics of the Australian housing system, 
  its policies and its problems. Let us start with a brief review of some of its 
  most distinctive characteristics.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>1&#9;The Dominance of 
  the Market in the Production and Allocation of Housing</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In Australia, most aspects 
  of housing provision are undertaken by the private sector. Governments do, however, 
  have a role in providing resources for housing assistance and in establishing 
  a framework for private sector provision, for example, planning and building 
  regulations, taxation and other financial subsidies. Not all countries are as 
  dependent on market provision as Australia, setting aside a larger role for 
  government. <B>See B6</B> for overview of policy.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>2&#9;The Dominance of 
  Home Ownership</B></font></P>
<I>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Australia has been a home 
  owning society for longer than any other advanced industrial country. Its level 
  of home ownership was already almost 50 per cent in the late 19th century, a 
  figure still not achieved by most other advanced industrial countries today. 
  While a few other nations have now achieved levels similar to the Australian 
  average of 70 per cent over the last two decades (see Table 1), the fact remains 
  that<I> Australia continues to be in the forefront of countries in terms of 
  the importance of home ownership</I>. In the last decade or so home ownership, 
  particularly for younger households, has been under intense pressure, and the 
  rate of ownership among new purchasers is falling. <B>Go to B1</b></font></P>

  the Detached House</b></font></P>
</B> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Australian cities are some 
  of the largest in the world in geographical area. The major reason for this 
  is the dominance of the detached house. Most other countries, at a similar stage 
  of economic and social development, have a greater mix of residential building 
  forms. Australia has something of the order of 77.7 per cent detached housing, 
  although there are variations from city to city. <B>Link B3</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>5&#9;The Relatively 
  High Rate of New Housing Demand for an Advanced Industrial Society</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Most advanced industrial 
  societies now have relatively subdued demand for new housing. These countries 
  have lower rates of household formation because of historically low birth rates, 
  an aging population, and low to very little migration. Australia still maintains 
  a relatively high rate of household formation, although the rate is contracting 
  and may approximate the low rates of demand of other equivalent countries in 
  a decade or so. <B>Go to F</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">6&#9;The Small-Scale and 
  Fragmented Nature of the Building Industry</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Related to the dominance 
  of the detached house is the fact that our building industry is dominated by 
  small-scale producers, with few building firms being national. The typical Australian 
  firm operates in one State or region, has less than three workers, and builds 
  about eleven dwellings per annum.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>7&#9;The Separation 
  of Housing Development and Production</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In many countries, the 
  purchase of land, its subdivision into areas for residential construction, and 
  the actual construction of a dwelling are undertaken by the one firm. This is 
  relatively unusual in Australia, although becoming more common than it once 
  was.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>8&#9;The Dominant Role 
  of Large State Housing Authorities in Social Housing</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Social housing in most 
  advanced Western societies is provided by a mix of community organisations, 
  housing associations, cooperatives and local government. In Australia none of 
  these are important. The major owners and managers of social housing are the 
  public housing agencies of each the States, with that of New South Wales being 
  the largest provider (128,000 dwellings). <B>Go to B</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">9&#9;The Small Role of 
  Community Housing</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The corollary of the dominance 
  of public housing provision in Australia is a small role for the community housing 
  sector. Its origins derive from the same factors which contributed to the development 
  of social housing generally within the Western world, that is, the activities 
  of social reformers and philanthropic organisations concerned about the living 
  conditions of the poor. Until the 1980s, community housing in Australia (unlike 
  Europe) received little government sponsorship. Since then it has steadily expanded, 
  although it is still small by overseas standards or relative to the public sector.

  and Important Role of the Private Rental Sector</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The private rental sector 
  in Australia is relatively large, accounting for around 22 per cent of the housing 
  stock. As Table 3 shows, the sector declined slowly in the postwar era but began 
  to recover in the 1980s as home ownership became more expensive, lifestyles 
  changed, and government policy became more supportive of the sector. By international 
  standards the sector operates in a fairly deregulated environment, with no rent 
  controls and fairly minimal residential tenancy controls. Distinctive attributes, 
  besides the deregulated environment, include the large proportion of rental 
  stock that is detached housing, the dominance of small investors (most investors 
  own only one property) and the lack of any institutional investment. <B>Go to

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>The Context of Housing 
  Provision</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The above points summarise 
  the main characteristics of the Australian housing system. How well it works 
  and for whom is not only a function of the system itself but of the economic, 
  social and political context in which it operates. All countries must grapple 
  with management of a diverse range of economic, social and environmental demands. 
  To this effect, <I>all countries have evolved a particular approach to the management 
  of these demands. The Australian approach reflects our particular economic structure 
  and social and political heritage</I>. It is an approach which is far from universal 
  in its principles and characteristics. Other countries have approaches which 
  range from very similar to markedly different. This will have major repercussions 
  for the form of housing and housing policy. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While all countries are 
  different, many do share general attributes, and it is possible to aggregate 
  them even if it is in a rough and ready form. One categorisation is in terms 
  of those which are <I>market liberal</I> and others which are <I>social democratic. 
  </I>The former share a greater emphasis on the market; they value individualism, 
  consumer choice and self-help and have lower taxes and a smaller role of government. 
  Labour markets and financial markets tend to be less regulated, and industry 
  protection is lower. Australians have coined the term <I>economic rationalist</I> 
  for this form of society. Australia, along with the United States and New Zealand, 
  are market liberal or economic rationalist societies. Social democratic societies, 
  while still market societies, place a greater emphasis on government, have higher 
  taxes and share values of community and communitarianism. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The market liberal institutional 
  arrangement, along with the policies and values that go with it, explains some 
  of the distinctive features of the Australian housing system such as the low 
  proportion of social housing and the dominance of home ownership. Among other 
  things it is also a cause of higher levels of poverty than in social democratic 
  societies – a factor that places considerable stress on the small social housing 
  sector. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Another key feature of 
  the Australian institutional structure is its federal system of governance. 
  The federation of the colonies in 1901 created a constitutional environment 
  with significant implications for the housing system. The federal constitution 
  has meant that most of the laws applying to housing – for example, residential 
  tenancy legislation, property law, building regulations and planning controls 
  – are State or local government based, with the States protecting their rights 
  vigorously. Unlike in the United States or Canada, there is no largish federal 
  agency responsible for policy directions in housing, with the result that there 
  is nothing which resembles an Australian housing policy. The Commonwealth, however, 
  has historically had taxing powers and therefore most of the revenue. Thus, 
  while States and local government – particularly the former – provide or set 
  the context for housing provision, arrangements have had to be made with the 
  Commonwealth for funding.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>The Drivers of Housing 
  Change</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This website<I> </I>to 
  date has sketched in outline terms a framework for understanding how any country’s 
  housing system works. All housing systems are dynamic and constantly evolving 
  to adapt to changing circumstances. In advanced industrial countries most are 
  currently going through a period of change and reform. Much of the objective 
  of this website is to provide an understanding of these changes and the implications 
  for Australian housing. It is useful to briefly summarise the major changes 
  shaping housing provision both in Australia and internationally if we are to 
  understand the potentials and problems of the Australian housing system.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>1&#9;Industrial Restructuring</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All advanced capitalist 
  countries are going through a process of industrial restructuring, in order 
  to achieve greater international competitiveness among themselves and with the 
  emergent Asian nations. This is creating outcomes of considerable importance 
  for housing and housing policy. A review of the major literature on industrial 
  restructuring and an analysis of empirical trends over the last decade would 
  indicate two important outcomes: </font></P>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Relatively higher levels 
    of unemployment for longer time periods, compared to earlier decades of the 
    postwar era; and,</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Substantial increases 
    in casual labour, both because of the need for a more flexible workforce and 
    because a number of the growth industries (for example, services and tourism) 
    are characterised by a dependence on casual labour. </font></LI>
</UL>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Both outcomes suggest that 
  a substantial minority of households in most countries will be on very low to 
  low incomes, with important implications for housing need and demand. Unless 
  there are significant income support programs to top up low labour market incomes, 
  signs point to considerably larger numbers in the 21st century who will be unable 
  to afford private market provided housing as we know it. This may produce new 
  private initiatives to keep housing affordable (for example, more multi-unit 
  housing), new forms of adaptive behaviour by lower income households (for example, 
  shared living arrangements) or new forms of housing assistance. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>2&#9;Social and Spatial 
  Polarisation</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One of the unintended outcomes 
  of spatial restructuring in the interests of efficiency and competitiveness 
  is what is increasingly called <I>social and spatial polarisation</I>. This 
  term captures the notion that while the benefits of restructuring may flow to 
  many – perhaps most – households, a sizable minority will be bypassed. <I>There 
  will therefore be greater polarisation between the affluent and non-affluent; 
  in the absence of countervailing policies, this will increasingly take on a 
  spatial dimension</I>. The concern by some is that the affluent will reside 
  in certain parts of cities and in certain regions, sometimes in gated and walled 
  communities, and those less well off in other increasingly resource-deprived 
  and unsustainable communities. How to create sustainable communities that minimise 
  crime, violence, welfare dependency and family breakdown will be a major housing 
  and planning challenge in coming decades. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>3&#9;Efficiency</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Driven by the requirements 
  of industrial restructuring, perceived problems of government debt and – more 
  recently – international recession, governments over the last decade have become 
  more concerned with economic efficiency than during the ‘long boom’ years of 
  the postwar era. This is particularly the case with the more market liberal 
  societies such as Australia. Principles encompassed by the term <I>efficiency</I> 
  which have relevance for housing policy include:</font></P>
<UL>
  <I>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Privatisation, which 
    is premised on the assumption that private provision is more efficient than 
    government provision;</font></LI>
  <I>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Targeting, which requires 
    identification of those in greatest need and targeting resources specifically 
    to such groups;</font></LI>
  <I>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Market discipline, which 
    assumes that market prices will produce better decision making by providing 
    a measure of monetary discipline;</font></LI>
  <I>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Visibility of subsidies, 
    which requires that any subsidy be easily identified and costed, thereby facilitating 
    financial accountability and responsibility;</font></LI>
  <I>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Client accountability/consumer 
    sovereignty, which captures the idea that clients or consumers know best their 
    specific needs, thereby preventing inefficiencies created by bureaucratic 
    determination of need; and,</font></LI>
  </i></i></i></i></i> 
</UL>
<I><I><I><I><I>
<UL>
  <I>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Externalities, which 
    captures the idea that private and government actions have unanticipated costs 
    and benefits for the wider economy and society, and thereby measures of efficiency 
    extend beyond narrow accounting measures of costs.</font></LI>
  </i> 
</UL>
<I>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>4&#9;Management</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For various reasons, the 
  non-private housing stock in all countries up until the late 1970s was managed 
  in a rather bureaucratic style, even where cooperatives were a large part of 
  the stock. Subsequently there has been a push towards management reforms. While 
  the objectives may be the same – to make decision making more client sensitive, 
  to empower clients and to create greater efficiency – the balance between these 
  objectives and the appropriate reforms is different from country to country. 
  In Australia it has seen a fostering of community housing as an alternative 
  management approach to public providers.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The push for better management 
  is not just a public concern. Private renters have not necessarily been served 
  well in the private rental sector, with estate agencies treating it as a side 
  business to selling. In recent years there has been a push towards more professional 
  management of this sector.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>5&#9;Urban Form</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A concern for urban form 
  has waxed and waned over the postwar years. It is now very much back on the 
  agenda, with housing policy being seen as intrinsic to achieving a more efficient, 
  equitable and environmentally sustainable urban form. In Canada, New Zealand 
  and Australia, the concern is with urban consolidation, while in Europe and 
  the United States it is very much linked with inner urban revival (for example, 
  the United Kingdom and the United States) or urban conservation (for example, 
  Denmark and Germany). </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>6&#9;Household Formation</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The most important determinant 
  of both housing demand and housing need is the rate of household formation. 
  Table 4 shows household formation rates and highlights the very different situations 
  confronting the various countries.</font></P>

<p></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Source: Annual Yearbooks 
  (respective countries)</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The European countries 
  have had a much lower rate of household growth, and therefore housing demand, 
  than Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. It can be argued 
  that it is easier to address housing needs in a context of lesser, rather than 
  greater, demand.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>7&#9;Household Diversity</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While there may be differences 
  in household growth between countries, all share a tendency to household diversity. 
  The stereotypical nuclear family is becoming less important, and housing now 
  has to meet the needs of single parents, singles, group households and childless 
  couples. Moreover, diversity is being further created by greater ethnic and 
  lifestyle differences in a multicultural society such as Australia.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>8&#9;Affordability</B></font></P>
<I>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Most advanced industrial 
  countries have experienced eroding affordability over the last decade, and the 
  provision of affordable housing is a major objective. Unfortunately, the articulation 
  of an objective does not ensure success in addressing it, as few countries appear 
  to have made major inroads into improving affordability despite major policy 
  reforms. However, any discussion of affordability problems requires some specification 
  of the affordability concept and what a <I>problem</I> represents. Thus, in 
  Australia, we may complacently accept that housing costs, on average, only consume 
  12.6 per cent of household income and therefore conclude that there is no affordability 
  problem. The issue in Australia, as in all advanced industrial nations, is not 
  whether there is a general affordability problem, but whether there is one for 
  specific groups and whether the trend is towards continued erosion of affordability 
  for such groups.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Affordability is principally 
  a problem for newly forming households beginning their housing careers, for 
  single income households (mainly single parents and single persons) and for 
  groups who, for whatever reason, have low incomes. Typically, the measure of 
  housing affordability is some yardstick criteria of housing costs as a proportion 
  of income, such as not more than 20, 25 or 30 per cent. The greater the number 
  exceeding the yardstick, the greater the affordability problem. The evidence 
  from virtually all countries reviewed shows that the numbers experiencing such 
  a problem are growing. Housing policy reform is increasingly being shaped by 
  an awareness of this.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">However, the degree to 
  which housing affordability is being experienced as a problem depends on the 
  existing character of the housing market, the form and degree of government 
  intervention (including comprehensiveness of welfare programs) and the state 
  of the economy. It would appear that affordability is more of a problem in countries 
  with a small social housing sector – and, conversely, private market dependence 
  – and leaner welfare systems. Thus, the problem appears less intense in Germany 
  and Denmark.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>9&#9;Poverty and Low 
  Income</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Any discussion of low income 
  housing policy and affordability must give some attention to the incidence of 
  low income and its most extreme manifestation, poverty, as well as the determinants 
  of this incidence. This is not an easy task as there are difficulties both in 
  defining income and attributing causal connections. Direct income for an individual 
  or household is derived from participation in the formal labour market or, if 
  outside the market, by income support from the state, for example, pensions 
  and benefits. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Indirectly, income can 
  be determined by the degree and form of the <I>social wage</I>, that is, goods 
  and services provided free of charge or at subsidised prices which increase 
  a person’s or household’s disposable income relative to consumption of these 
  goods and services at market values. Education, health care, child care and 
  public transport are characteristic of social wage goods. The cumulative effects 
  of labour market income, income support and the social wage can create very 
  different income positions between societies. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Market liberal societies 
  such as the United States and Australia, with their relatively unregulated and 
  flexible labour markets, can have people working at much lower incomes for a 
  given position than more regulated and centralised markets such as the social 
  democratic societies of Europe. Moreover, income support benefits tend to be 
  lower, so there is greater poverty. Thus, the proportion of persons and households 
  requiring low income housing assistance may be greater in market liberal societies. 
  How this is handled in policy terms is a complex issue as there are two broad 
  means: to subsidise people into private rental housing through rent assistance, 
  or to construct social housing and subsidise people by allocating them such 
  housing. Which is best has long been debated, but Australia is currently moving 
  from the latter to the former.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>10&#9;Special Needs 
  Groups</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For much of the postwar 
  era, housing policy in most countries was concerned with fostering production 
  to the degree that absolute shortages were removed or slums cleared and replaced. 
  <I>It is really only in the last decade or so that there has been a move towards 
  fine tuning of housing programs to meet specific needs. This direction recognises 
  that uniform or homogeneous policies deny the diversity of needs and demands 
  of households and individuals</I>. It is also, in many respects, a response 
  to an increasingly diverse demographic structure mentioned above. Groups that 
  have come in for specific recognition include the aged, indigenous populations, 
  the homeless and students. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The groups that get programmatic 
  recognition, or at least debate, vary from country to country. For example, 
  homelessness is rarely discussed in Germany and Denmark, students in Australia 
  and Canada, native populations other than Australian Aboriginals, Canadian Inuit 
  and New Zealand Maoris. All countries are concerned with the aged, largely because 
  all are experiencing an aging of the population. European countries, in particular, 
  have a high proportion of aged, as Table 5 shows.</font></P>

  and affordable housing will always require subsidy for many households. The 
  private sector simply cannot price a product to provide affordability for all 
  households. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But what is the most efficient 
  form of subsidy? Is it in the form of directly providing subsidised social housing 
  to households or is it in the form of some financial assistance or supplement 
  to enable them to shop around for their housing, for example, Australia’s rent 
  assistance. While Australia has made something of a transition from direct to 
  indirect assistance in the last two decades, the debate as to where to go in 
  the future is continuing. For more details on the rationale for the two models 
  of assistance, <B>go to C7</B>.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By contrast with other

  1980s Australia still had ownership levels higher than most other countries.

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>1&#9;Income Levels and 
  Ownership</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One way of addressing this 
  question is to dismiss some popular explanations. Particularly in the 1960s 
  and 1970s, one common view was that home ownership was a measure of Australia’s 
  affluence and that, as other countries became richer, they would emulate this 
  preference. As a number of observers have pointed out, however, after analysis 
  of comparative data on tenure and levels of affluence, there is clearly no relationship. 
  Table 2 ranks countries in terms of affluence and also shows their level of 
  home ownership. Switzerland, which has the highest level of income per capita 
  in the world, has a very low level of home ownership. Australia, which ranks 
  nineteenth in terms of income, has the third highest level of ownership after 
  Iceland (second in income level) and New Zealand (twentieth in income level). 
  Anyone seeking a pattern in this data would be hard pressed to find a relationship 
  between income and home ownership.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A second argument is that 
  home ownership is somehow a natural tenure form, reflecting an innate desire 
  of people to own, as well as recognition that it is an innately superior tenure. 
  The above data also, in part, invalidates this argument. If home ownership were 
  natural, then all countries would gravitate to it as income rose. Poverty, in 
  this context, is seen as the factor which blocks people’s natural inclination 
  to ownership. The more important argument, as expressed by Kemeny (1983), is 
  that there is nothing innately superior in home ownership. It only takes on 
  that appearance in the context of the financial and legal support available 
  for this tenure relative to others. Thus, what are the perceived attractions 
  of home ownership that could make it the <I>natural</I> choice of households?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Most people are attracted 
  to ownership because it is secure (<I>a home of your own</I>, offering freedom 
  to renovate and decorate), is cheaper over a lifetime, and is an investment. 
  In Australia most would agree that only ownership offers these characteristics. 
  But in some countries, residential tenancy legislation allows the tenant security 
  for life and, indeed, allows for a rental property to be passed on to children. 
  Similar legislation offers tenants the right to renovate and decorate. In many 
  countries, a different set of financial structures and subsidies means that 
  ownership is often more expensive than other tenure types. Further, the decline 
  in new housing demand as the population ages and the reduction in subsidies 
  for ownership have removed the tendency for house price inflation and capital 
  gain. In many European countries, particularly the United Kingdom, home ownership 
  has become a financial millstone for households who have mortgages in excess 
  of the worth of their property. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This is not to undermine 
  the importance of home ownership, but simply to point out that its success is 
  dependent on the institutional context. Australia has, for various reasons, 
  always had a context which is conducive to ownership.</font></P>

  influential book, was<I> </I>that the desire for ownership is a response to 
  government policy. He and others documented the many postwar policies which 
  encouraged ownership and, by contrast, the relative absence of support for public 
  and private rental. Regulated low mortgage interest rates, subsidies to first 
  homebuyers and the absence of capital gains tax have all been identified as 
  factors encouraging ownership. There is no doubt that such policies had their 
  impact in reinforcing ownership in the postwar era, but they fail to explain 
  why home ownership was important in earlier years when it had little government 
  support.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The success of one tenure 
  cannot be considered in isolation from others. If another tenure is perceived 
  to be more attractive than home ownership for various reasons, then ownership 
  may not prosper. This has not been the case in Australia. One reason for the 
  lesser importance of ownership in many European societies has been the growth 
  of social housing. With the size of this sector going up to around 40 per cent 
  in, for example, the Netherlands and Sweden, home ownership by comparison just 
  has to be squeezed out. In Australia, where political decisions have kept the 
  social sector small, there was no threat to home ownership. This is of indirect 
  importance to ownership, but still does not explain its dominance in the 20th 
  century.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>4&#9;Migration</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Australia is a country 
  of migrants. The indigenous Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have been 
  swamped by successive generations of migrants, mainly from poor working-class 
  backgrounds. Most came from large industrial cities where they lived in rental 
  housing which gave them little security. Upon arrival in Australia, a housing 
  sector that promised some control over their own destiny must have had immense 
  allure. It is important in this context to note that, within one or two generations, 
  most ethnic groups achieve ownership rates higher than the longer established 
  population.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>5&#9;Available Land 
  and an Appropriate Finance Industry</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In much of Europe, the 
  bulk of rural and urban land was owned by a small number of enormously rich 
  landed gentry who had little interest in subdividing it for individual ownership. 
  Ultimately, many did convert their land for residential purposes and took on 
  the role of private landlords, but they were reluctant to give up their land 
  for ownership. By contrast, Australia had no landed gentry as the land was resumed 
  from the Aboriginals who, without Western concepts of private property and a 
  legal system to support it, were seen to have no rights to the land. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Land was purchased by people 
  who saw it as a mechanism for quick profits. As documented by Michael Cannon 
  (1966), a finance and development industry emerged in the 19th century which 
  was geared to speculation in selling land for ownership. This tradition, while 
  moderated from the excesses of that era, is still important today. The system 
  of housing provision in Australia, consistent with the country’s market liberal 
  status, is still geared to the provision and maintenance of ownership. Thus, 
  the historical manner in which the finance, development and building industries 
  were structured here has preordained Australia to be a home ownership nation.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Those who migrated to Australia 
  wanted to own their own home, and this was matched by an industry which was 
  interested in selling land and houses for ownership. Together with the supportive 
  government policies since World War II, the preconditions were in place for 
  a home owning society.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In summary, then, the dominance 
  of ownership has no simple explanation, but rather is a confluence of features; 
  some have their origins in the pattern of settlement in the 19th century and 
  some reflect the characteristics of the era following World War II, including 
  relative equality of income, full employment, high levels of migration and public 
  policy. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>B2&#9;Social Housing</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Australian social housing 
  sector has few parallels internationally. Reflecting the particular characteristics 
  of our cities, our often confused and dichotomous values (a market liberal society 
  with a strong sense of fairness) and the nature of the federal system (strong 
  central and State government, and weak local government), Australia created 
  in the immediate postwar era a highly centralised public housing sector. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Whereas in most countries 
  social housing systems evolved around the community sector or local government, 
  that is, with some reference to locality and local identity, in Australia they 
  did not. The system was built up around eight large State and Territory housing 
  providers, funded largely by the Commonwealth government through the Commonwealth-State 
  Housing Agreement (CSHA). Local government has had a minimal role in public 
  provision. In total, around 5 per cent of the stock is social housing (see Table 
  1).</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The community sector, although 
  now around for at least two decades, manages only about 0.2 per cent of this 
  stock. The sector had a late start compared to many other countries and is still 
  very small, but it is now the growth component of social housing, as a result 
  of a conscious decision by governments to provide greater choice within the 
  system. Table 1, column 3, shows the size of the community sector in each State 
  and Territory and highlights its smallness compared to public housing. <B>Link

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Another major characteristic

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The small size of the sector, 
  along with its other distinctive features, has created a complex and challenging 
  environment for social housing workers, discussed in more detail in <B>C8</B>.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As indicated above, the 
  social housing system is funded through the CSHA, which is negotiated every 
  three to four years. It provides grants to the States (with the States matching 
  these grants) on the basis that they will cover capital outlays, and with the 
  expectation that recurrent costs will be covered from revenue, principally rent. 
  The subsidy between what tenants can afford and the actual rental (called a 
  rebated rent) is carried as a liability of the State Housing Authorities (SHAs). 
  Public tenants, unlike private renters, do not receive rent assistance from 
  a central income support agency as is common in many other countries. The internal 
  rebate is a distinctive and problematic element of the Australian system, particularly 
  as greater targeting means that more and more households receive a rebate.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Since the early 1990s, 
  funds under the CSHA have been contracting (see Table 3). Gross payments have 
  fallen dramatically and will continue to fall to their lowest level for twenty 
  years. Net CSHA funds will fall from $671 million in 1995-96 to around $500 
  million by 2000-2001, a fall of 25 per cent in real terms. This will see the 
  number of dwellings added to the public housing stock decline from 5,000 in 
  1995-96 – itself a fifteen year low – to barely a thousand or so. From a Commonwealth 
  government perspective, this contraction in social housing grants has been compensated 
  by a huge growth in rent assistance to the private rental sector over the last 
  decade and a half. Which is the best method of providing housing assistance 
  is a contested issue which will, in all likelihood, be increasingly debated 
  over the next decade. <B>See C7</b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the 1990s the social 
  housing sector was the subject of a number of reforms, due to its endemic problems, 
  including:</font></P>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The huge waiting list, 
    which throughout the 1990s exceeded the number of vacant properties by a ratio 
    of four to one (Australia-wide there are roughly 220,000 applicants on the 
    waiting list, and only 50,000 dwellings become available each year, mainly 
    through re-lets);</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The dominance of pensioners 
    and beneficiaries, with the outcome of 83 per cent of all tenants being on 
    subsidised or rebated rents (DSS 1998). The increasing liability, combined 
    with contracting Commonwealth outlays to the States, means a decline in SHA 
    revenues to the degree that their financial viability is at risk; <B>See C2</b></font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The aging of the stock, 
    with the associated problems of repair and redevelopment needs. This is a 
    problem of inadequate past maintenance, poor quality of construction during 
    the 1950s and the sale of the best quality stock in the 1970s;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The concentration of 
    much of the stock on large outer urban estates and in provincial towns (almost 
    all in the form of detached housing) where there were limited labour market 
    opportunities due to economic restructuring which bore disproportionately 
    on these areas. This problem thrust to the fore issues of client choice and 
    portability of housing subsidies so that people, in theory, could move to 
    where the jobs are;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The perceived mismatch 
    in stock, that is, small households occupying largish dwellings when more 
    rent could be extracted if larger households were moved into such properties;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The horizontal inequity 
    issue, that is, low income households in the private rental sector were perceived 
    to get considerably less housing assistance through rent assistance than public 
    sector households through their rebates. The argument was put that eligible 
    public tenants received on average $3,000 of subsidy, while eligible private 
    tenants received only $1,000. In fact, the difference is nowhere near as marked, 
    as the average is affected by the enormously high rebates in Sydney as a result 
    of it having the rent structures typical of global cities like London, New 
    York or Paris. Stripped of the Sydney effect, there is a lesser horizontal 
    inequity problem; and,</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A perception in many 
    quarters that the monolithic SHAs were poor housing managers, insensitive 
    to clients’ needs, unimaginative in policy directions and broadly unaccountable.

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Most other countries, at 
  a similar stage of economic and social development, have a greater mix of residential 
  building forms than that of Australia which is dominated by the detached house 
  (77.7 per cent of all dwellings) There are, however, variations from city to 
  city with Sydney having a lower proportion than other capital cities. Single 
  family dwellings including semi-detached and terraces account for another 7.3 
  per cent, leaving only 15 per cent of stock in the form of multi-family dwellings 
  such as flats and apartments. This is much lower than in other advanced industrial 
  countries.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Australian house is 
  large by world standards, and is getting larger. Paradoxically, as the house 
  has increased in size, the block or lot has contracted and is now smaller than 
  it was two decades ago. More houses are two storey, and there has been a change 
  in the use of outdoor space.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The reason why Australia 
  has disproportionately built detached housing, when most other countries have 
  built mainly medium density, has not been adequately researched. It can be argued 
  that it is a response to the system of provision that has existed since white 
  colonisation, which includes the following factors:</font></P>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The long-time existence 
    of a small-scale building industry, often owner built, with little expertise 
    or few resources for constructing other housing forms;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The availability of 
    cheap and accessible land, which meant that there was little pressure to develop 
    alternative housing forms;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The dominance of home 
    ownership, with the corollary of a smaller rental sector. Landlords prefer 
    medium density housing as it is easier and cheaper to manage than detached 
    housing. The absence of the large private rental sector of other countries 
    meant that housing was commissioned for and by individual households rather 
    than large landlords;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A rapidly growing population 
    of migrants, mainly from dense inner city tenements and terraces, who no doubt 
    saw the detached house as symbolising a break with their unpleasant pasts;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A facilitative planning 
    system characteristic of a market liberal society that enabled – indeed, encouraged 
    – urban sprawl, a form of urban development that fits the detached house; 
    and,</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Pressure on local government 
    to enact planning controls and covenants that prevented housing other than 
    the detached house from being developed in many parts of our cities. This 
    restricted medium density housing to certain areas, mainly the inner city 
    with its already established dense housing form.</font></LI>
</UL>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The large size of the Australian 
  house and the allotment on which it is located means that our cities are very 
  low density. Table 2 compares the densities of world cities. Australian cities 
  are down at the bottom of the scale, with 18 or fewer persons per hectare. Hong 
  Kong, by contrast, has almost 300 persons per hectare. Such low densities are 
  problematic, particularly for lower income earners. Public transport services 
  in cities below 30 persons per hectare are rarely cost effective and often have 
  limited routes and timetables. This restricts the mobility of the poor, the 
  disabled, single parents and young or aged persons, that is, those who are less 
  likely to be car owners. It also tends to imply that the cities are more polluted 
  from car exhaust fumes, and very dependent on cheap and available energy sources.</font></P>

  Aldershot</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Medium density housing 
  has become the general term to capture a range of dwelling types including terraces, 
  flats, townhouses and small lot subdivision housing. The term really conflates 
  two different types of housing development, that is, multi-unit housing such 
  as apartments, and developments of detached and attached dwellings at higher 
  than normal densities. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The peak period for its 
  construction in Australia was 1965-75, mainly in the form of blocks of flats, 
  or what are referred to in Queensland as ‘six packs’, given their approximation 
  to a six pack of beer. For a variety of reasons, this design fell into decline 
  and has only staged a resurgence in recent years. This resurgence is mainly 
  an inner urban one, driven by changing lifestyles and demographics and by the 
  economic reality for some households that the single detached house, at least 
  in inner urban areas, is not affordable. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It is not only consumers 
  who are discovering the merits of medium density housing. All levels of government, 
  for a combination of economic and environmental reasons, have come to appreciate 
  that our existing pattern of low density development must be modified. In particular, 
  recognition of the high costs of infrastructure provision on the urban fringe 
  has encouraged a view that greater use should be made of existing urban infrastructure. 
  The inner areas of our cities are seen as having considerable potential for 
  <I>urban consolidation</I>. There are many pockets of underutilised land (although 
  these are rapidly being depleted) as a result of changing economic activity, 
  such as the relocation of manufacturing and warehousing to outer urban areas. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The process of urban consolidation, 
  which at the moment is essentially a policy of medium density housing, is an 
  inevitable response to a local, national and world environment which is very 
  different to that of previous decades. Unfortunately, it is often difficult 
  for people immersed in the demands of their daily lives to appreciate that we 
  have entered a new economic, social and urban order – an order increasingly 
  called the <I>postmodernist </I>world to distinguish it from the <I>modern</I> 
  world of sustained economic growth and expansive government that characterised 
  the postwar years up to the 1970s.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many people still believe 
  that what held for the past will hold for the future, and therefore our cities 
  should continue as they have done for decades. This denies that the purchase 
  costs of housing today, despite relatively low interest rates, are of a very 
  different order to the period from 1950 through to the early 1980s; that high 
  unemployment will be with us for the foreseeable future; that governments no 
  longer have the discretionary funds for urban expansion; that the demographic 
  structure and, therefore, housing needs are very different to those of past 
  decades; and that Australian industry is going through a marked restructuring 
  which has all sorts of income and employment implications.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The postmodernist Australia 
  is simply one which will not enable the old urban form, based on the assumption 
  of the detached house for all families, to be sustained to the degree of the 
  past. This is not to suggest that urban consolidation is a universal and comprehensive 
  panacea for Australia’s urban and economic problems. There are major problems 
  with consolidation, and the reality is that the detached house on the fringe 
  will continue to provide the bulk of new housing. Housing provision cannot be 
  ahead of consumer preferences, and these are not changing so rapidly that the 
  present increase in medium density housing can be heralded as a revolution which 
  will see the end of the detached house. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>B5&#9;Housing Policy</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There are two starting 
  points for understanding housing policy and program delivery in Australia. The 
  first is the recognition that Australia is a federal system, with different 
  policy roles and responsibilities for the three levels of government. The second 
  is the appreciation that many policies other than housing policies have important 
  housing outcomes, for example, taxation policy.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Commonwealth government 
  provides much of the finance for social housing assistance and, in conjunction 
  with the States, sets the parameters for delivery of social housing programs 
  through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA). The Commonwealth also 
  provides rent assistance for private renters. It is also important in terms 
  of indirect policy, notably, taxation policy.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">State governments manage 
  and deliver public housing and set the framework for the operations of the community 
  sector, and to a large extent fund that sector. They also collect land tax and 
  stamp duty on property sales, have responsibility for residential tenancy legislation, 
  and establish the broad urban and regional planning framework in which local 
  government operates. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Local governments have 
  a very limited role in actual housing provision (unlike in many other countries) 
  and largely concern themselves with land use planning, particularly in the control 
  of estate development and building permits. These can have important indirect 
  outcomes on the form and affordability of dwellings.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The major housing policies 
  and programs are outlined below.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>1&#9;Commonwealth-State 
  Housing Agreement</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The CSHA is an agreement 
  between the Commonwealth and each State and Territory government for the provision 
  of certain forms of housing assistance. These are:</font></P>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Public housing (the 
    bulk of the funds);</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Community housing;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Home purchase assistance 
    (minimal compared to the past); and,</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Housing assistance for 
    special groups such as Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders.</font></LI>
</UL>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The funds provided by the 
  Commonwealth are matched by the States and Territories. Funding through the 
  CSHA to the States over recent years has declined in real terms, although this 
  must be put in the context of greatly expanded outlays on rent assistance by 
  the Commonwealth, so that overall levels of housing assistance have been maintained. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The CSHA has been around 
  since 1946 and is renegotiated every three to four years, with the terms and 
  conditions varying greatly over time in the discretion that it allows the States 
  and in policy emphasis. Some grants within any of the CSHAs have been tied to 
  special purpose programs in order to ensure that the States actually commit 
  funds to these areas. These have included pensioner rental housing programs, 
  Aboriginal rental housing programs, community housing and crisis accommodation. 
  Funds for public housing have generally been untied, although there are requirements 
  for performance, data collection and planning and policy. The most recent CSHAs 
  (1989 onwards) have been multilateral agreements, with the same conditions required 
  of all States and Territories, although the CSHA for the period 1999-2003 is 
  a bilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and individual States which allows 
  for greater discretion for States to chart different housing assistance courses.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>2&#9;Rent Assistance</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For most of the postwar 
  era, public housing through the CSHA was the major form of housing assistance. 
  A form of rent assistance called supplementary assistance was first introduced 
  in 1958 but with very limited eligibility, largely widows and single aged pensioners, 
  and at the discretion of the Commonwealth Department of Social Service (DSS). 
  Its limited eligibility is reflected in the fact that in 1963 there were only 
  9,518 recipients. At the time, this approach was seen as a cheaper option than 
  a more general pension increase. With some widening of eligibility, this remained 
  in place until 1983 when the newly elected Labor government expanded the scheme 
  to include almost all DSS pensioners and beneficiaries, as well as making it 
  an entitlement rather than a discretionary scheme. As Table 1 shows, the amount 
  of assistance has increased substantially as well.</font></P>

  the end of that period, a sharp increase in unemployment, the numbers of recipients 
  expanded almost exponentially. In March 1998 average rent assistance per week 
  was $29.73, with some 900,000 recipient individuals or households. In 1997-98 
  it was estimated that the total outlays of the rent assistance program were 
  $1.6 billion, compared to $420 million in 1984. In real terms this represents 
  a fourfold increase (DSS 1998: section 5.2).</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Effectively, private rent 
  assistance has now replaced public housing as the major funding platform for 
  low income housing assistance in Australia. However, because it is not overly 
  generous, many recipients are still likely to be in or near poverty even after 
  its receipt. Importantly, it has more of the characteristics of an income support 
  program than a rent assistance program and, unlike the programs of Canada, the 
  United States (Section 8) and most Northern European countries, there is no 
  link to any supply side subsidies. Despite rent assistance, poverty after meeting 
  housing costs has increased in Australia from the mid-1970s, with the largest 
  number still in the private rental sector.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The shift from social housing 
  expenditure reflects a philosophical change in how we view the best way of providing 
  housing assistance. It is argued that bricks and mortar investment, as typified 
  by public and community housing, requires bureaucratic allocation of housing 
  and ongoing control over the lives of households. By contrast, rent assistance 
  gives households the ability to choose accommodation which is consistent with 
  their needs. Moreover, for any given budgetary allocation, for example, $1 million, 
  a much greater number of households can be assisted through rent assistance 
  than through social housing investment. <B>See C7</B> for more on this topic.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These arguments sound compelling 
  but, as with all policy issues, the reality is more complex. Over time, there 
  is ultimately some point where the cumulative effect of investment in actual 
  dwellings (by virtue of the sheer amount of stock constructed) assists more 
  people than rent assistance. Similarly, there are issues that the availability 
  of rent assistance cannot address, for example, shortages of affordable accommodation 
  in certain locations, discrimination, housing quality, and ability to link recipients 
  with support services as in social housing.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The future of the next 
  CSHA will depend on whether social housing can demonstrate that its benefits 
  (including any non-shelter benefits such as family maintenance, employment and 
  educational opportunity, and sustainable communities) exceed the benefits (including 
  non-shelter benefits) from rent assistance or some equivalent private rental 
  program.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>3&#9;Home Purchase Assistance</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Australia has had a tradition 
  of home ownership longer than virtually any other advanced industrial country 
  and, at least in the first four postwar decades, the dream and reality of ownership 
  were underpinned by a raft of home purchase assistance programs. Today there 
  is little direct assistance, although the introduction of a GST in July 2000 
  was accompanied by a compensatory $7,500 grant for first homebuyers. The major 
  forms of assistance are indirect, notably, exemption from capital gains tax 
  for the principal residence and the absence of imputed rental income arising 
  from ownership. There is also a small, highly targeted home purchase and mortgage 
  assistance program within the CSHA, but this is only around $30 million spread 
  across all the States and Territories.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>4&#9;Private Rental 
  Tax Assistance</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A tax provision called 
  negative gearing allows landlords to claim any loss from rental operations (including 
  costs of interest payments) as an offset to other earnings. This is an untargeted 
  program and, unlike in many other countries, is not related to achieving any 
  specific housing outcomes such as affordability, quality or location. Newly 
  constructed private rental housing is eligible for a 2.5 per cent building allowance.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>5&#9;Homelessness Policies 
  and Programs</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For a variety of reasons, 
  homelessness has increased substantially in recent decades but, unlike many 
  other countries, Australia does have a comprehensive and nationally coordinated 
  program to address the problem, if not solve it. The Supported Accommodation 
  Assistance Program (SAAP) is a Commonwealth funded, but State and Territory 
  administered, program which provides recurrent funding for salaries and other 
  operational costs associated with housing and support assistance to homeless 
  people and those in crisis. The Crisis Accommodation Program (CAP) provides 
  the capital funding for dwellings for those in housing crisis.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">SAAP agencies focus on 
  six main groups: young people, single men, single women, families, women escaping 
  domestic violence, and cross-target or multiple target groups. Of these, the 
  two accounting for the bulk of funds are young people and women escaping domestic 
  violence. In recent years, spending on SAAP and CAP programs has exceeded $250 
  million, with the bulk of funds (around $200 million) in the SAAP component. 
  A national data collection process has been established for SAAP to provide 
  comprehensive information on who is presenting for homelessness assistance and 
  the reasons for their crisis situation. This data is collected by the Australian 
  Institute<B> </B>of Health and Welfare. </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">An Australian housing worker’s 
  role is a complex, difficult and rewarding one. They need to be a social worker, 
  a tenant manager, a property manager, a team worker, a networker, a financial 
  manager and a negotiator. The degree to which any of these skills is used depends 
  on the particular position and the type of housing agency in which they work, 
  but all these roles are required at some stage, and many at the same time. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The tasks which dictate 
  these multiple roles derive in part from the highly targeted nature of the social 
  housing system where virtually all tenants are poor and most suffer from some 
  form of disadvantage, whether that be unemployment, domestic violence, drug 
  and alcohol addiction, disability, AIDS or homelessness. But it also relates 
  to the small size of the stock compared to many other countries and, in many 
  cases, its condition. The small size means that matching housing needs to an 
  actual dwelling is difficult, more so if it is the wrong size or in poor condition.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This is a tenant management 
  role, but also a social work and networking role. A potential applicant will 
  be interviewed for eligibility, but this seemingly technical task involves much 
  more than assessing their attributes against eligibility criteria. The ‘social 
  worker’ role may require sensitively drawing out whether the person has problems 
  which mean that they may not be able to sustain a tenancy without some form 
  of ongoing support. If this is the case, when the person is allocated a property 
  the housing worker will have to liaise with other agencies to try and obtain 
  the necessary level of support – this requires networking and negotiation skills. 
  Each agency has broadly similar eligibility requirements of residency, income 
  assets and documentation of special needs. For more information on the principles

  determining what level of rent a tenant should pay, and advising them of their 
  obligations re payments, for example, due dates, and notification of changes 
  in income and household arrangements that might affect rent payments. In the 
  State sector, tenants pay a market rent and receive a rebate to keep levels 
  of rent affordable. In the community sector it is more complicated, reflecting 
  the different forms of community housing (<B>see C7</B>). In some cases, tenants 
  can get a rebated rent and receive rent assistance; in other cases, they only 
  get a rebated rent. Most community housing agencies change a market rent, but

  keep up their rents. For most clients this is a relatively simple administrative 
  task, particularly when they agree to direct debiting. For a variety of reasons, 
  some fall into arrears, and this often requires social work and negotiation 
  skills to resolve a satisfactory outcome. Some may think that the simple solution 
  is to evict the tenant but, like all aspects of social housing administration, 
  the reality is more complex and eviction should be a last resort. For more information

  Relationship</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Creating a culture of client 
  service in social housing is difficult, particularly at the level of worker/client 
  relations. Tensions clearly exist between them, which is understandable given 
  the context of their interaction, but if these are identified and examined this 
  can provide the basis for improvements in service delivery, to the benefit of 
  all. What are these tensions and where do they derive from?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>1&#9;Impact of Wider 
  Social Values</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some of the problem is 
  that workers transfer the values of the wider society to their jobs. The principle 
  manifestation is the ‘blaming the victim’ ideology, whereby the problems of 
  social housing tenants are made out to be caused by the tenants themselves (that 
  is, drinking, gambling and work avoidance), rather than by the structural problem 
  that the private market simply cannot provide affordable housing for all, irrespective<B> 
  </B>of an individual’s or household’s personal attributes. This ideology is 
  entrenched quite deeply in Australia, so it is not surprising that some housing 
  workers bring the same values to their work setting and treat households as 
  if they were the ‘undeserving poor’.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Similarly, in the current 
  climate of ‘commercialisation’ and ‘efficiency’, workers can too easily be seduced 
  by this language and culture. In issues of stock management, for example, it 
  is clear that many workers have come to accept that social housing tenants underoccupying 
  a dwelling represent an inefficiency and should be forced to move to a more 
  appropriate dwelling. This implies that social housing tenants do not have the 
  right to see their house as a home, as a source of their identity and a repository 
  of memories and sentiments, in the way that residents in other tenure sectors 
  do. Such beliefs are anathema to quality client service. Thus, in an organisational 
  climate where tenants are seen as burdens on the public purse, it is not surprising 
  that many workers have evolved mixed attitudes towards clients, who in return 
  have developed a suspicion of the workers.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One of the rationales for 
  the community sector has been that it is more tenant focused, in effect, more 
  client oriented. But even tenant cooperatives have not been insulated from the 
  concept of the ‘deserving poor’, with the tenant sometimes suspicious of the 
  attitudes and behaviours of fellow tenants, and the occasional adoption of allocations 
  practices which exclude households that do not share the participatory values 
  of the cooperative.</font></P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">2&#9;<B>Budget Constraints</b></font></P>
</B> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">No organisation has unlimited 
  resources, and some are more limited than others in their resource capacity. 
  Human service organisations such as housing agencies cannot supplement their 
  income from private market activities, for example, by selling their product 
  at a profit. Workers therefore operate in a financial context where there is 
  often simply not enough staff to provide a quality service. Requiring workers 
  to increase output and quality without matching resources can create tensions 
  which flow over to clients.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>3&#9;Organisational 
  Structure</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Historically, the bulk 
  of low income housing delivery in Australia has been by large public housing 
  authorities. The more diverse and normally smaller housing organisations that 
  characterise most other countries have been lacking, with the exception of a 
  very small cooperative sector. For much of the postwar era, these large organisations 
  were highly centralised in their management structure. The steps to regionalise 
  by devolving delivery to a more local level or by establishing a viable community 
  sector only really occurred in the last decade. This means that there has existed 
  a culture of delivery which tends to be remote from the clients and their needs. 
  Changing that culture will not occur overnight.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Largish organisations must 
  develop complex communication systems to ensure that workers know what to do 
  and why. The larger the organisation, the more intermediaries – either persons 
  or memos or reports – through which a message is filtered from senior management 
  to the coalface. Two problems can emerge here: communication distortion and 
  communication lag. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Communication distortion 
  refers to a situation where the intent of the message may be modified or changed 
  by the time it gets to the worker. For example, a message about a need for immediate 
  repairs may be reduced to a less important status by the time it has been communicated 
  to the maintenance team. Communication lag refers to the fact that it may take 
  considerable time for the appropriate workers to get the message, and meanwhile 
  they are operating on one set of behaviours while management are expecting a 
  different set. Clients may be the unintentional victims of these internal communication 
  problems. Thus, a policy statement on rental arrears or allocations, by the 
  time it reaches the shopfront workers, may have changed from a recommended status 
  to a mandatory status as it is interpreted by different layers of the organisation.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Any organisation is essentially 
  bureaucratic and evolves rules and regulations to suit the needs of the bureaucracy, 
  which may be very different from the needs of the client. The worker caught 
  between the requirements of the organisation and those of the client becomes 
  the focus for conflict. As an employee of the organisation, the tendency is 
  to side with the rules and procedures. The result may well be an alienated client 
  group.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On the other hand, there 
  is the dilemma that clients caught up in the challenges and difficulties of 
  everyday life may not understand the wider role of housing agencies and the 
  necessity for rules and procedures. Australian-born clients often express hostility 
  to newly arrived migrants in public housing, seeing it as evidence of their 
  ability to manipulate the rules. Stereotypes are often built around such misunderstandings 
  (for example, the rich migrants who buy their way into public housing). The 
  effect on tenants is to ‘prove’ the inequalities and inefficiencies of public 
  housing management. Unfortunately, principles of priority housing and of obligations 
  to refugees are either unknown or misunderstood by many clients.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Similarly, clients with 
  a pressing housing need may believe that they should be housed immediately and 
  find it difficult to accept waiting time or priority rules created by the organisation 
  for reasons of fairness. The worker becomes the outlet for their anger.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>4&#9;Conflicting Worker/Client 
  Expectations</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many workers have expectations, 
  both of their work roles and of their clients, which clash with the clients’ 
  expectations. A maintenance officer, for example, may see his or her role as 
  one of fixing a physical problem such as damaged floor boards. The client may 
  also have this expectation, but in addition may expect the worker to listen 
  sympathetically to his or her problems – in other words, to be a de facto social 
  worker. Failure to express interest disappoints the client, who subsequently 
  complains about insensitive workers.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>5&#9;Difficult Clients</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some clients in public 
  or community housing are simply difficult. One characteristic that many have 
  is ‘time hedonism’, which may manifest itself in a hostile behaviour towards 
  waiting. They see waiting as evidence of red tape, while an inability to understand 
  the need for rules and regulations aggravates their impatience. They are unable 
  to understand why workers cannot accept their word for the need for immediate 
  action, and why supporting documentation is necessary (more red tape!). Such 
  people may view planning ahead as unnecessary and tedious, and will expect assistance 
  when they feel like visiting the office, even though a different time may have 
  meant less queuing and frustration. By contrast, the worker may want very ordered 
  and rule driven behaviour. Put the two together and there is a recipe for conflict.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Generally, it is the difficult 
  clients who are constantly presenting themselves to workers, either directly 
  – by making complaints – or indirectly – by being the households that others 
  are complaining about. Non-difficult households (by far the greater number) 
  rarely present themselves, so workers may develop a general view of clients 
  which is based on those who do present as being difficult, and adopt management 
  practices accordingly. Moreover, workers have to address the frustration that 
  the community service obligations of social housing mean that difficult households 
  – even those that may threaten assault or are selling drugs – cannot be pursued 
  with the vigour or relentlessness that is more possible in the private rental 
  sector. Even when action is taken through the Residential Tenancy Tribunals 
  or courts, determinations often reflect the ‘circumstances of the case’ which 
  may include the fact that problem tenants, if evicted, will have nowhere else 
  to go. Such decisions are an understandable source of frustration for workers.</font></P>

</B> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Most housing workers are 
  on relatively low to reasonable incomes. Few receive the high incomes associated 
  with senior management. Clients generally are on much lower incomes, and a sizable 
  minority do not work for these incomes but are on various forms of income support. 
  Some of these clients, despite lower incomes and a lack of employment, are in 
  better housing than the workers themselves (some, such as single parents or 
  single persons, at a relatively young age). It is therefore only natural that 
  some workers may resent this situation and, not being fully aware of the circumstances 
  that might have precipitated entry into public housing (for example, domestic 
  violence) or of the broader objectives of social housing, will carry some of 
  this resentment into their work setting.</font></P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">7&#9;<B>Cultural Differences</b></font></P>
</B> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Differences in culture 
  can create problems in worker/client relations. These can take a number of dimensions, 
  as the following examples illustrate:</font></P>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A victim of torture 
    and oppression may have a fear of authority figures. You as a worker are just 
    such an authority figure. Will he or she deal with you with confidence?</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A person from a society 
    which shares a general belief that women should not be in positions of authority 
    has to deal with a woman housing worker. Again, how successful do you think 
    that worker/client relationship will be?</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You have allocated a 
    house to a person who has a strong belief in feng shui. The house infringes 
    many of its principles and they want a reallocation. What do you do?</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A household from a society 
    that has no tradition of private property or of the concept of rent has fallen 
    into arrears. How do you deal with this?</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For some groups, the 
    death of a household member means that the dwelling must be vacated for a 
    period of time as part of the grieving process. The tenants have no expectation 
    of paying rent in this period. What do you do? </font></LI>
</UL>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The examples could continue, 
  but these few highlight the difficult management task in dealing with people 
  from a different culture, particularly when they may be presenting at a time 
  of stress. It is also important to remember that all cultures are heterogeneous, 
  and one cannot operate on the basis of stereotypes. Not every member of an ethnic 
  group or of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities shares the same 
  housing needs and values. Just as in our own culture (the reader can here define 
  their own culture), there is considerable diversity. While some Aboriginals 
  and Torres Strait Islanders may want a dwelling that is unconventional by white 
  Australian standards and is designed to fit the needs of an extended family, 
  others may want a conventional detached house on a quarter acre block. Being 
  sensitive to another culture requires recognition of its diversity, not just 
  that the culture may be different.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The problem referred to 
  earlier of stereotypes about recent migrants is also a problem of cultural differences 
  between social classes. Judged from the perspective of the wider society, many 
  Australians born in social housing are ‘failures’ who have been – and may feel 
  themselves to be – marginalised from that wider society. Some have evolved a 
  culture that makes their position acceptable among their own peer groups or 
  class (for example, a rejection of middle-class values) and adopt behaviours 
  and views which may be anathema to workers who do not share that culture.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The concept of culture 
  is not just of relevance in terms of ethnicity or social class. Every organisation 
  attempts to develop a culture – that is, a distinct set of values, practices 
  and beliefs which are broadly shared by many of its members – but it cannot 
  be assumed that everyone in the organisation shares that culture. Many cooperatives 
  and community housing groups have a philosophy or culture of tenant participation, 
  believing in the empowering process that comes from participation and self-help, 
  but not all members will share this. Some are in community housing only because 
  it offers an affordable roof over their heads, and resent the time required 
  to participate in decision making. This can be a source of tension and, unless 
  there is tolerance of difference in values and needs, can create major management 
  problems.</font></P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">8&#9;<B>Stress at the Time 
  of Negotiation</b></font></P>
</B> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Clients normally require 
  assistance only at a point of crisis, for example, failure of plumbing, falling 
  into rental arrears, or a clash with a neighbour. When all is going well, no 
  assistance is necessary. The problem here is that negotiations with housing 
  workers are probably least well done when one is experiencing troubles or difficulties. 
  The client is on the back foot from the start and will in all likelihood approach 
  the negotiation with some trepidation, anger or other crisis induced behaviour. 
  To the worker, such behaviour may come across as unrealistic and excessively 
  demanding.</font></P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">9&#9;<B>On First Appearances</b></font></P>
</B> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The client’s first impression 
  of a housing agency will probably come from the reception process, and how this 
  is handled can set up a negative or positive experience in terms of worker/client 
  relationships. Winning client support and creating impressions of quality service 
  start at this point. The first time a client deals with the housing organisation 
  will determine how they view that organisation. Telephones should be answered 
  quickly and politely or, if there is a voice mail system, calls returned as 
  soon as possible. Callers should know who they are talking to, and information 
  should be provided clearly. Letters should be handled with equal promptness 
  and clarity. In both situations, performance criteria can be implemented to 
  facilitate improvement. </font></P>

    provided by the housing authority or community agency should be available, 
    along with leaflets about related services, for example, social security;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Publicity should be 
    in clear English and in the ethnic languages used by clients;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ideally, activities 
    for young children should be provided, such as comics, books and soft toys;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Screens or counters 
    separating staff and clients are not a good idea, but there should be an easy 
    method for calling for help if necessary, such as alarms and back-up staff; 
    and,</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There should be separate 
    space for confidential interviews, as most people would not want to talk about 
    domestic violence or disputes with neighbours where they can be heard by others.</font></LI>
</UL>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These issues do not get 
  to the heart of the reception process. Many problems experienced at this level 
  could be avoided if appropriate activities or strategies were adopted which 
  reduced the need for direct staff/client interaction or provided clients with 
  better information before confronting counter staff. For example, pamphlets 
  in ethnic languages, while useful, should not be the sole publicity mechanism 
  for programs. Ethnic newspapers and radio may be more effective.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>10&#9;Power Relationships</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The staff/client relationship 
  is a power relationship, consciously or unconsciously. The power derives from 
  the housing worker’s control, however indirectly, over resources. As gatekeepers 
  to housing, workers can affect how long a client waits, how much information 
  they get, the manner in which that information is provided, whether they are 
  referred on to anybody else, and how promptly their complaint or request is 
  acted on. Clients can resent this uneven relationship and can interpret actions 
  as exercises in power where no such intent was meant. The client’s only real 
  sanction is behaviour; they can respond by being nice, aggressive, compliant, 
  polite, rude or violent. More productive responses may occur where there is 
  less visible expression of power on the part of workers.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>11&#9;Summary</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This review draws out one 
  obvious point: that the problems are not grounded in the characteristics of 
  housing workers alone, but in the wider society, the organisational climate 
  and the attributes of the clients. Better client services require reforms and 
  change at all levels. To expect workers alone to create the conditions for a 
  quality housing service would be misplaced and unfair.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All organisations which 
  manage rental housing, whether in the private, community or government sectors, 
  are faced with arrears (debts) owed to them by tenants and former tenants. Each 
  organisation has to develop strategies to minimise debts and to manage and reduce 
  them when they occur. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">State Housing Authorities 
  and community agencies may have detailed procedures manuals for housing workers 
  or property managers whose job it is to manage arrears. Less commonly do they 
  have a clear framework outlining the organisation’s policy on arrears, the role 
  of arrears management in overall customer service, and the financial and political 
  environment in which arrears management takes place.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>1&#9;What Are Arrears?</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Arrears are most commonly 
  taken to mean rent monies owed by tenants to housing agencies. In fact, there 
  are a number of types of arrears, and various situations in which the housing 
  agency must manage debts owed by customers and ex-customers. Figure 1 shows 
  some of the major types of arrears. The list is not exhaustive and the actual 
  names adopted for types of debt vary. The figure shows that arrears derive from 
  previous and current tenancies, different debt areas (rents, water) and different 
  parties (a housing agency or a third party).</font></P>

  Financial Viability of Housing Agencies</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Community and government 
  housing agencies do not exist to make a profit (capital gain and/or operating 
  profit), as do private operators, although they may aim at a given return on 
  assets. They generally aim to alleviate housing related poverty by providing 
  affordable and secure housing for households on modest and lower incomes. Despite 
  these more altruistic aims, all housing agencies are concerned with their financial 
  viability, and uncontrolled arrears or a high level of arrears may threaten 
  this. Moreover, a high level of arrears is an equity issue; the money foregone 
  to the system means money not available to house other tenants. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>3&#9;Arrears from a 
  Customer Perspective</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B><I>3.1&#9;Significance 
  of Arrears for Customers</I></B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Arrears pose serious problems 
  for tenants and ex-tenants as well as for housing agencies. They may exacerbate 
  pressures on a household facing other financial or personal problems. Debt to 
  a housing agency may limit or preclude options such as rehousing or transfer 
  to more suitable accommodation. For debt relating to a current tenancy, the 
  household’s tenure and stability may be thrown into doubt. This stability may 
  be essential to maintaining affordability of housing, stability of a family 
  unit, access to employment, and access to services and facilities.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">However, despite the serious 
  implications that arrears may have for customers and housing agencies, relatively 
  little is known about why tenants fall into arrears. In lieu of adequate research 
  on the causes, housing workers and others are often left to develop their own 
  theories, a common one being the distinction between ‘can’t pay’ and ‘won’t 
  pay’ customers. Workers may make their own judgements when households in apparently 
  similar circumstances differ in their ability to pay.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B><I>3.2&#9;Customer Circumstances</I></B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Government and community 
  housing agencies have improved their targeting to the extent that the vast majority 
  of tenants are on low incomes and are eligible for a reduced rent (rent rebate). 
  Reduced rents are generally related to income and household composition and 
  reflect the low income profile of tenants. Low income may mean that there is 
  an insufficient buffer to meet even basic costs such as housing, and periodic 
  crises may lead to arrears. Some of these circumstances could include:</font></P>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Irregular or casual 
    employment, leading to income fluctuations;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Unexpected costs – health; 
    repair or replacement of old or unreliable items; fines; large bills which 
    may be difficult to predict, for example, water charges;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Other commitments and 
    priorities, such as payments for a car in areas of poor public transport; 
    and,</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Pressure to acquire 
    consumer items, often on credit – advertisers, neighbours and friends may 
    all add to the pressure to ‘buy now and pay later’.</font></LI>
</UL>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It is important that housing 
  agencies analyse arrears by household size, income type and area, to know more 
  about the profile of those in arrears. There is some evidence, for example, 
  that despite increased social security payments for children in recent years, 
  larger families are more prone to fall into arrears.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B><I>3.3&#9;Attitudes 
  of Tenants</I></B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some housing workers and 
  others maintain that tenant attitudes to rent payment have changed over the 
  years. It is commonly said that older people see rent as their highest priority, 
  whilst many younger people see other payments as deserving priority. It is sometimes 
  suggested that government and community housing agencies are seen as a ‘soft 
  touch’ and that there is an expectation that nothing much will happen even if 
  arrears continue to accumulate. There is no doubt that there are ‘problem tenants’ 
  in terms of rent arrears, but whether they account for the bulk of them is unclear.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some hypothesise that rental 
  arrears are seen as a form of interest-free credit by tenants, although there 
  is little definitive evidence. If true, it would imply skills in financial management 
  by tenants, rather than the lack of skills in this area which is often assumed. 
  Others have suggested that an emphasis on tenant and consumer rights, and a 
  reluctance to proceed to the stage of eviction for political or philosophical 
  reasons, may not encourage regular payment. Again, there is little hard evidence 
  for this.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There is some suggestion 
  that regular payment may be associated with tenant satisfaction with their homes. 
  The rent rebate system means that rents are the same for similar households, 
  whether they live in the most modern housing or the oldest or least appropriate. 
  Tenants in poorer stock may feel less inclined to make regular payments. Where 
  there have been ‘rent strikes’ in relation to current housing conditions, arrears 
  accumulate rapidly and have been difficult to bring under control again.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B><I>3.4&#9;Housing Agency 
  Management Practices</I></B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Housing agency management 
  practices may also contribute to the accumulation of arrears. Some argue that 
  the cessation of local rent collection schemes (for example, small sub-offices, 
  door-to-door collections or rent vans) has contributed to arrears increasing. 
  There may be less personal contact between housing workers and tenants, with 
  little opportunity to stem arrears before a larger and less manageable amount 
  accumulates. Tenants may be less inclined to use alternative collection mechanisms 
  on the fortnightly basis which is often required.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Perceptions of inaccuracy 
  in rent or maintenance charges may contribute to arrears. Variations to rebates 
  may appear to be retrospective but any additional income may already have been 
  spent. The combination and frequency of review of gross rents and rebated rents 
  may lead to confusion and affect payment. Maintenance charges may be considered 
  to be unfair and may remain unpaid while they are being contested.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Staff turnover, workload 
  and varied perceptions of the role and priority of arrears management may also 
  contribute to an increase in arrears. Consistency of action is usually required 
  to bring down arrears. Another factor may be the reliability and accessibility 
  of information provided to housing workers. Immediate and up-to-date access 
  to rental accounts aids arrears management, and this may not always occur. Targeted 
  reporting of arrears is essential to ensure that changes can be dealt with quickly.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Fragmentation of aspects 
  of housing management and poor coordination between housing agencies and various 
  ‘partners’ in housing management may also contribute to arrears. In some cases, 
  this is because of the time which elapses between initial arrears and agreement 
  on the type of action to be taken. This may reflect differences in underlying 
  philosophy between the housing agency and its management partner.</font></P>

  to Housing Agency Stock</I></B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Most housing agencies have 
  a variety of stock, sometimes built up over many years. Some has been carefully 
  designed to minimise ongoing costs to tenants. Much older stock has not been 
  designed in this way, and tenants may be faced with higher than anticipated 
  costs which may affect rent payment capacity, for example:</font></P>

    to construction material, orientation of housing etc.;</font></LI>

<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">High user pays costs, 
    such as high water use gardens coupled with pressure to maintain garden standards, 
    particularly in drier regions; lack of drying facilities leading to drying 
    and laundry costs, or expensive alternatives such as disposable nappies;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Costs of furniture – 
    lift access or narrow stairways may mean that old and cheaper furniture will 
    not fit; </font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Costs associated with 
    providing furnishings – tenants may need to provide floor coverings, blinds 
    or curtains;</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Costs associated with 
    security concerns, such as higher insurance premiums, difficulties in obtaining 
    insurance, car insurance rates, costs associated with alarm systems or guard 
    dogs for personal security;</font></LI>

    vandalism, such as repair to cars, repair to uninsured items, premiums for 
    call-outs; and,</font></LI>

    the location of stock, such as transport costs.</font></LI>
</UL>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The housing agency clearly 
  has more direct control over its management practices and stock than over the 
  other factors mentioned. It is important that arrears management is not merely 
  seen as the efforts of housing workers in chasing up arrears. Effective arrears 
  management will also depend upon other parts of housing agencies, including:

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>4&#9;Arrears and the 
  Social Objectives of Housing Agencies</B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The previous sections outlined 
  why arrears are important both to housing agencies and customers. This section 
  looks at the issues which housing agencies face in developing an overall framework 
  for arrears management.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B><I>4.1&#9;Legal and 
  Political Context</I></B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Housing agencies operating 
  rental housing are landlords and must comply with their rights and responsibilities 
  under the residential tenancies legislation which applies in their State or 
  Territory. Social housing workers may find the landlord role a difficult one. 
  They may have become involved in the management of rental housing in the belief 
  that they were fulfilling social objectives, such as providing more appropriate 
  or better managed low rental housing. They may find balancing these objectives 
  with the financial viability of the agency a difficult task. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many housing agencies wish 
  to be seen as ‘model’ or good landlords by customers and the wider community. 
  However, strictly following the letter of residential tenancies legislation 
  would lead them down a linear path culminating sometimes in recovering possession 
  of properties through eviction of tenants as the ultimate means of managing 
  arrears.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In practice, the linear 
  path approach to arrears may often be tempered by other considerations. Housing 
  Ministers and senior managers of housing agencies are faced with conflicting 
  pressures which may lead them to intervene as arrears recovery procedures become 
  more serious from the point of view of both the customer and the agency. These 
  interventions are often not well received by workers whose job it is to recover 
  arrears and who may see them as capricious or ‘soft’. In particular, interventions 
  to ‘pull out’ on evictions at the eleventh hour are seen as lack of support 
  for the efforts of housing workers and may be remembered for years afterwards.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Housing agency managers 
  and ministers are aware of the need to achieve rent income and the problems 
  of the rental operations deficit. They are also aware of the scrutiny by community 
  advocates, the media and the general public when eviction is threatened or carried 
  out in the name of arrears management. Ministers in particular tend to be sensitive 
  to the confrontation displayed in eviction proceedings, especially where children 
  are involved. Some may be reluctant to take away secure housing from households 
  that perhaps owe only a few hundred dollars. For these reasons, last minute 
  offers of payment (or part payment) may be accepted, even if offered by a third 
  party. These decisions reflect concern that the primary purpose of the agency 
  is to give people security in their housing, not to take it away.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On the other hand, the 
  political climate today is one of ‘sound financial management’, and housing 
  agency managers and ministers are keen to ensure that high or increasing arrears 
  do not mean that they are seen as imprudent financial managers. From the housing 
  workers’ point of view, decisions made at various review points may seem to 
  be inconsistent, sometimes reflecting concern to be a model landlord and to 
  achieve certain social objectives, and at other times driven by a fear of being 
  found to be poor financial managers.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B><I>4.2&#9;Eviction and 
  Arrears Management</I></B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Housing workers and tenants 
  sometimes feel that mixed messages are given out by housing agencies about the 
  importance of arrears management and the particular techniques which the agency 
  condones. This is hardly surprising in the light of the above discussion. On 
  one hand, agencies seem to put forward their social objectives and emphasise 
  customer service, yet, at times, issues of financial viability seem to be overriding. 
  Perhaps the most extreme example of this can be found in attitudes towards eviction.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some see eviction as necessary 
  in hardcore arrears situations, to stop the accumulation of debt and to ‘remove 
  the problem’. It is commonly believed that eviction is a deterrent to other 
  tenants in arrears and encourages them to pay. Others find great difficulty 
  with eviction as it runs counter to the social objectives for which the agency 
  was established. They point out that some high-flying businessmen of the 1980s, 
  for example, have had tens and sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars of 
  debt written off and maintain their houses, whilst ‘little people’ can lose 
  their homes over a debt of a few hundred dollars. Some see this as double standards. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Little is known about the 
  effectiveness of eviction as a tool in arrears management, although there are 
  plenty of anecdotes. Eviction stops debt accumulating further, but is unlikely 
  to result in payment of arrears already owing. An evicted household is unlikely 
  to see payment of arrears as a priority, and as a result of eviction they are 
  even less likely to have the means to pay. Some housing workers welcome eviction 
  as a means of ‘clearing the books’ of some current arrears. In fact, the debt 
  does not disappear, it is merely transferred to ‘vacated arrears’, which are 
  often the responsibility of some other part of the organisation. Vacated arrears 
  are rarely given the attention of current arrears, and ex-customers’ whereabouts 
  may be unknown. The recovery rate for vacated arrears is usually low, and an 
  internal transfer of the debt in the agency’s books may be the main impact of 
  eviction from the point of view of the cash deficit on rental operations.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">More commonly, households 
  simply vacate their homes under threat of eviction. Again, forwarding addresses 
  are often not known, and maintenance charges may be incurred through lack of 
  attention to the property at the time of vacation. The prospect of recovering 
  the debt is remote. However, this action does stop the debt accumulating further, 
  if this is the agency’s only objective.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Housing agency arrears 
  procedures often include flow charts showing reminder letters as the beginning 
  of arrears management and eviction as the end point. There is a danger of eviction 
  coming to be seen as an end in itself, rather than enabling households to remain 
  in their accommodation while managing and recovering their arrears.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In practice, households 
  who vacate under threat of eviction or are evicted may seek further housing 
  from the agency in the future. Most agencies specify that full repayment of 
  the debt is required before housing is offered, but exceptions are made in situations 
  of priority need, including domestic violence. At this stage, the housing agency 
  again has to balance social objectives against reducing its rental deficit. 
  The problem does not disappear with eviction or vacation under threat of eviction.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B><I>4.3&#9;Setting an 
  Overall Framework</I></B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In recent years, there 
  has been an increasing awareness of customer or client service. Agencies have 
  been giving greater attention to provision of better information, reliability 
  in service provision, and respect for the rights of customers, including the 
  right to confidentiality and privacy. Within this context, housing agencies 
  must provide a clear framework for actions when customers are in arrears. In 
  developing a framework, some of the questions that need addressing are:</font></P>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">What level of arrears 
    does the agency consider acceptable?;</font></LI>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B><I>5.1&#9;Arrears Prevention</I></B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Housing agencies have traditionally 
  concentrated on arrears control and recovery, and comprehensive strategies to 
  prevent arrears have been less common. Those considering arrears prevention 
  (or encouragement to pay) might adopt a range of strategies across the agency, 
  not only aspects of housing management. Some possible elements are as follows.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><I>Incentives</I></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many commercial organisations 
  offer incentives for customers who pay by the due date, such as cash discounts, 
  competitions and prizes. Housing agencies have tended to concentrate on penalties 
  for non-payment or late payment, rather than on incentives for regular or prompt 
  payment. Incentives have been considered to be somewhat frivolous if they have 
  been thought of at all. Some government bodies do use incentives, for example, 
  local councils sometimes offer the chance to win a prize such as a holiday for 
  ratepayers who pay by the due date.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It would be possible to 
  identify incentives for regular and prompt payment by customers of housing agencies. 
  These could include a week’s free rent at Christmas, some flexibility and choice 
  in maintenance items, or entry into a lottery to win a house and land. Some 
  argue that incentives only serve to reward the ‘slightly less poor’ at the expense 
  of the ‘very poor’, whilst others see them as a possible reward for those who 
  see rent payment as a priority. There is little information about the success 
  of incentives in the public sector, and the private sector is often reluctant 
  to make public the impact of particular incentive schemes.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A social housing system 
  is largely defined by its ‘not for profit’ status. The reason it does not make 
  a profit is that it provides housing which is affordable for those on low incomes. 
  How social housing ensures affordability differs from country to country. In 
  most countries a form of cost rent (that is, a rent that covers the cost of 
  providing the dwelling) is charged, not a market rent. If this is still not 
  affordable, tenants typically receive a rent supplement or allowance from a 
  central government authority to keep their rent below some benchmark, for example, 
  20 to 30 per cent of income.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Australia has a different 
  system. Here a market rent is charged (<B>see C3</B>) and the housing agencies 
  themselves give a rebate back to the tenant out of their revenue, ensuring in 
  the process that actual rent paid is kept to some acceptable level such as 25 
  per cent of income. In practice, rebate cut-offs can be struck in three different 
  ways: a flat rate of, say, 20 per cent across all income ranges; a sliding scale 
  from some minimum, for example, 20 per cent at $300 per week to 25 per cent 
  above $650 per week; and a stepped scale, for example, 20 per cent to $350, 
  25 per cent from $350 to $500, and 30 per cent above $500. In Australia, most 
  States have had a sliding scale, although Queensland (up to 1994) and Tasmania 
  had a stepped system for their income related rent subsidy mechanism. </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A rebate relates not only 
  to rents, but also to the tenant’s income. The degree of rebate is thus related 
  to measures of income, with all the problems of defining and measuring eligible 
  income. In the first CSHA formula set down in 1945, the rebate formula applied 
  was based on the Commonwealth basic wage and the child endowment scheme. It 
  was assumed that the basic wage was a relatively accurate measure of the cost 
  of maintaining a minimum standard of living, and that the child endowment scheme 
  removed the necessity for rents to take account of the number of children in 
  the family. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The formula operated by 
  measuring the ‘family income’ and then assessing capacity to pay. Where it exceeded 
  the basic wage, rent was set at 20 per cent of income, but where it was less 
  than the basic wage, the rent was one-fifth of the basic wage, plus one-third 
  of the difference between the basic wage and the family income. For those on 
  very low incomes (for example, half the basic wage), actual rents could be as 
  low as 12 to 13 per cent of income. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With variations from State 
  to State, this system remained in place until the late 1960s. Its relative generosity 
  was enabled by the fact that only relatively few households were on rebates. 
  As Table 1 shows, in the late 1960s these were around 15 per cent of all households, 
  compared to around 90 per cent today. Some of the growth is explained by changes 
  in eligibility (single parents were largely excluded from public housing prior 
  to the mid-1960s), but mainly by demographic change, for example, marital breakdown 
  and aging, and structural changes to the economy which have created higher house 
  prices and rents and left greater numbers of unemployed and underemployed.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Source: Burke (1998b); 
  <I>Housing Assistance Act: Annual Report 1996-97</i></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Over the last two decades, 
  these changes have also precipitated a move away from the original rebate formula 
  to broader formulas as rising house prices, inflation, dual incomes and changes 
  to the level and form of social security benefits rendered the basic wage inappropriate 
  as the measure of ‘livability’.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The overall level of rebate 
  in Australia has been estimated at around $3,600 ($73 per week) per household, 
  compared to around $1,200 for private rent assistance. However, if this was 
  disaggregated for regional or State impacts, the subsidy would be higher in 
  New South Wales – notably in Sydney ($96) – and much less elsewhere, for example, 
  $50 in South Australia and $61 in Western Australia (<I>Housing Assistance</I> 
  <I>Act: Annual Report, 1995-96</I>).</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For much of the community 
  housing sector, rebates are not the likely or actual method of subsidy. While 
  some old cooperatives in Victoria and South Australia managing public sector 
  property are recipients of the rebate, the newly emergent Australia-wide community 
  sector will typically receive a subsidy made up of DFaCS rent assistance (a 
  subsidy to the tenant) and operating subsidies (related to the properties). 
  The dilemma for the community sector and government is determining how much 
  operational subsidy is necessary to simultaneously ensure financial viability 
  and household affordability. <B>End C2</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">C3&#9;Market Rents</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Most social housing agencies 
  in other countries charge a form of cost rent, that is, a rent related to the 
  cost of provision of housing including amortised capital costs, depreciation 
  and recurrent cost, including staff costs. By contrast, Australia charges a 
  market rent, that is, what equivalent private sector housing is renting at. 
  This divorces the rent from any relationship to actual production costs, and 
  bases it on equivalent private market values. Given that the historic origin 
  of social housing was to provide a tenure sector with a rent structure that 
  was more affordable than market rents, it might seem something of a paradox 
  to then set social housing rents at market values. The rationale is twofold.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Firstly, it is argued that 
  any households not paying a market rent are receiving an implicit subsidy over 
  and above any rent rebate paid. This is seen as a subsidy because, if a public 
  sector house were rented out on the private market, it would bring the market 
  rent of equivalent housing for that type and location. For example, if the market 
  rent for a property was $150 but the household only paid $90 as a result of 
  a rebate, then the total subsidy represents $60. Aggregated for all households, 
  it is argued that a market rent method would then provide a benchmark by which 
  to measure the subsidy for the social housing system as a whole. In short, it 
  makes subsidies transparent. However, for most public sector households, so 
  long as the rebate mechanism remains the same as at present, it is largely irrelevant 
  whether there are cost or market rents. Only the minority of tenants not on 
  rebates will receive the pricing signals provided by market rents.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Secondly, there are of 
  course a minority (3 to 15 per cent, depending on State or Territory) of households 
  in the social housing sector who are on good incomes. This occurs as a result 
  of the process of time. People are allocated public housing at a low point in 
  their employment careers, and hence it follows that their income earning capacity 
  is at a low ebb. Some households do not remain at this ebb, and at a later date 
  in their public housing occupancy may find that their employment and income 
  earning capacity has greatly improved. It is argued that, as an equity issue, 
  these households or individuals should not be subsidised by virtue of receiving 
  a low rent, that is, those who can afford to do so should pay equivalent rents 
  to those of people on the same incomes in the private sector. Another argument 
  is that such households should not even be entitled to be in public housing, 
  given the sizable waiting lists, and should be encouraged through market signals 
  – that is, market rents – to exit.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A similar argument is used 
  with respect to changing household circumstances. Over time, a household may 
  move from child rearing, through to children leaving home, to loss of a partner 
  and, finally, to single person status. The household in its various permutations 
  may have been constantly resident in a three-bedroom dwelling, meaning that 
  in its final permutation, for example, a couple or single person, it is underutilising 
  the dwelling. A cost rent, being insensitive to housing characteristics, would 
  not send any signals to tenants about their underoccupying a dwelling. By contrast, 
  a market rent which reflected the size or locational aspects of the dwelling 
  would send price signals which would encourage relocation to a more appropriate 
  dwelling, thereby freeing the larger house for a larger family. This of course 
  only applies for non-rebated households, as a rebate blunts the effect of any 
  market signals, because the tenant feels no financial penalty after its application.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For either income or housing 
  quality factors, it is argued that market rents would facilitate a more efficient 
  use of a scarce resource as well as meeting both vertical<B> </B>equity goals 
  (those on higher incomes pay more) and horizontal equity goals (those households 
  on the same incomes in the private and public sector pay the same rent). This 
  is the system that many SHAs and the community sector have switched to, or are 
  switching to, and so it is important to expose it to more critical analysis 
  than the other methods.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While there are good arguments 
  for market rents, there are also arguments against them, including the problems 
  of actually setting rents for properties that have few private market equivalents 
  (for example, high rise) and the fact that they are subject to the vagaries 
  of private market forces, which makes for some problems of management. For example, 
  if a performance indicator is set such as proportion of household subsidy to 
  total market rents, is the outcome being measured one of changes in cost to 
  government of providing housing assistance, or is it just changes in market 
  forces? <B>End C3</b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sales Policy </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The sale of public housing 
  was a fashionable policy response in the United Kingdom and the United States 
  in the 1980s, and aroused considerable debate and attention. Yet it was old 
  hat in Australia. We had started the process almost two decades earlier with 
  the changes to the CSHA. The States endorsed the CSHA sales policy, but with 
  varying degrees of support. Tasmania immediately rejoined the CSHA, and used 
  CSHA funding to expand its already existing sales program. New South Wales and 
  Victoria took the opportunity to introduce and substantially expand the sale 
  of their CSHA funded public rental stock. South Australia was the least keen 
  on selling its stock, and relied instead on its existing home ownership sales 
  program, under which it built and sold dwellings to middle income applicants. 
  While Queensland and Western Australia sold a significant minority of their 
  CSHA stock, like South Australia they achieved most of their sales through existing 
  home ownership schemes that had been established before the CSHA had been put 
  in place. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">From 1945 t0 1969, almost 
  90,000 CSHA dwellings were sold Australia-wide, with all but 3,500 being sold 
  after the 1956 agreement. New South Wales and Victoria accounted for almost 
  two-thirds of total dwellings sold. In some years in Victoria (1959-60 and 1960-61) 
  and New South Wales (1956-57 and 1957-58), the number of CSHA dwellings sold 
  exceeded the number being built. By the end of the 1960s, Victoria had sold 
  43 per cent of its public housing stock, while Tasmania had disposed of 67 per 
  cent.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Awareness of the problems 
  of selling stock brought an end to sales in the 1970s, except for relatively 
  small numbers of stock that may have been surplus to requirements. In the late 
  1990s sales increased again in response to funding constraints. Most properties 
  sold are in gentrifying inner urban areas where the sales value can purchase 
  two or more properties elsewhere or be used for property upgrade. <B>End C6</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">C4&#9;Why Is Allocations 
  Policy Needed in Social Housing?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Public and community housing 
  exists in all advanced industrial countries because the private sector cannot 
  provide housing that is affordable or appropriate for all households. This is 
  partly because of the cost of such housing, and partly because of the low level 
  of incomes and the social and personal disabilities of certain individuals and 
  households. Before public housing emerged in Australia, that is, before World 
  War Two, private housing was non-affordable for many households, and some was 
  of such sub-standard quality that it affected the health not only of residents 
  but of the wider community. This was because the conditions of much inner city 
  housing in capital cities were so bad that thousands of houses were effectively 
  slums. Pressures for affordable and appropriate housing gave rise to the State 
  Housing Authorities and in the immediate postwar years to the Commonwealth-State 
  Housing Agreement which provides funds for public housing authorities in each 
  of the States.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">From the original inception 
  of public housing, some form of allocations policy was necessary. In 1946, State 
  Housing Authorities typically had only a few thousand dwellings, and were overwhelmed 
  by need. Given the tens of thousands of families who could not afford housing 
  or were living in slum conditions, who among them were to be given housing? 
  And once chosen, what housing were they to be given? </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This allocations dilemma 
  remains with State Housing Authorities today, as well as the community sector, 
  but is a more difficult policy and administrative task because social housing 
  now, compared to the early decades of the postwar era, caters for a greater 
  diversity of households. Up until the mid-1960s, public housing was mainly for 
  working, but low income, Australian-born households who were headed by an ex-serviceman. 
  Migrants (except British) were generally ineligible, and only rarely was access 
  considered for couples below 60 years of age with no children, single parent 
  households, singles, young people or any group not showing ability for independent 
  living. Today allocations policies encompass all household types, age groups 
  and countries of origin. The system is fairer but, in consequence, more complex.</font></P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1&#9;<B>The Demand for 
  Social Housing</b></font></P>
</B> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There are many reasons 
  why people desire social housing, but the lack of affordable housing is the 
  dominant one. The scale of the affordability problem in Australia was suggested 
  by the National Housing Strategy which found that in 1988 some 450,000 lower 
  income units (roughly equivalent to a household) in the private sector had housing 
  costs in excess of 30 per cent of their incomes, a level which is considered 
  excessive and would warrant eligibility for public housing. This figure could 
  be seen as representing the broad measure of public housing need in Australia.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By contrast, in 1997, there 
  were only 382,000 public housing units in Australia, with a new construction 
  rate and turnover rate that means roughly only some 51,000 new allocations can 
  be made annually. These figures illustrate the huge potential need relative 
  to supply, and why various ‘rationing’ methods are required to select those 
  households who are to gain access to public housing. And we need to remember 
  that the measure of need is an historical one, that is, 1988. Subsequent to 
  that date, the restructuring of the economy, increasing unemployment and the 
  adoption of policies that have widened income inequalities have probably substantially 
  increased the number of households in housing need. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 1997, approximately 
  240,000 households were on official waiting lists for public housing, compared 
  to 99,000 in 1981. While New South Wales had the largest absolute number (around 
  93,000), South Australia had the largest relative number (some 36,000). More 
  than half of the applicants nationally were single persons or sole parents. 
  These numbers represent an enormous increase in demand over the last decade, 
  despite the fact that only a minority of households who are potentially eligible 
  for public housing actually apply. The housing rationing task is thus one of 
  fitting 240,000 applicants into 51,000 vacancies.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Despite the difficulties 
  discussed above, devising and applying eligibility criteria in order to establish 
  a waiting list are straightforward compared to assessing the relative need of 
  eligible households to determine the order in which they will be offered housing.<I> 
  </I>Table 1 summarises the main strategies by which public and community housing 
  agencies order their waiting lists. Some systems are obviously more appropriate 
  than others in a particular context; for example, an emergency housing service, 
  by definition, requires a priority or merit system, whereas public agencies
