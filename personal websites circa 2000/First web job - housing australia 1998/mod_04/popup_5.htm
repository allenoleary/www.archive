        New Urban Forms - The End of Detached Housing?</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many people still 
        believe that what held for the past will hold for the future, and therefore 
        our cities should continue as they have done for decades. This denies 
        that the purchase costs of housing today, despite relatively low interest 
        rates, are of a very different order to the period from 1950 through to 
        the early 1980s; that high unemployment will be with us for the foreseeable 
        future; that governments no longer have the discretionary funds for urban 
        expansion; that the demographic structure and, therefore, housing needs 
        are very different to those of past decades; and that Australian industry 
        is going through a marked restructuring which has all sorts of income 
        and employment implications.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The postmodernist 
        Australia is simply one which will not enable the old urban form, based 
        on the assumption of the detached house for all families, to be sustained 
        to the degree of the past. This is not to suggest that urban consolidation 
        is a universal and comprehensive panacea for Australia’s urban and economic 
        problems. There are major problems with consolidation, and the reality 
        is that the detached house on the fringe will continue to provide the 
        bulk of new housing. Housing provision cannot be ahead of consumer preferences, 
        and these are not changing so rapidly that the present increase in medium 
        density housing can be heralded as a revolution which will see the end 
        of the detached house. </font></p>
