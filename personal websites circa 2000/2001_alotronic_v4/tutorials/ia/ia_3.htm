<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Aims dictate 
  the structure</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As with a building, 
  so with a website: you have to know what you're trying to do before you can 
  effictely structure information. This could be stated in quite a prosiac way 
  like 'sell clothes online'. But really is that useful?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>. 
  There mission is not to 'sell books' but to 'help readers make book buying decisions'. 
  Quite different, and it explains completely the types of information provided 
  on their site and the way it is structured. For instance the ability to add 
  begative reader reviews to a page on a book doesn;t immediately seem like a 
  great idea, but it increases trust and honesty (even if they exploit their own 
  workers by paying crap and using stock options as a carrot!).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the context 
  of your project, can you come up with an aim for the site that is 'poitive' 
  and creative like Amazons? This is the first step in good Information Architecture; 
  knowing why you're getting people to your site in the first place...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Context and 
  narrowing focus</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you first 
  get someone to your site you need to contextualise them very quickly. This can 
  mean a number of things:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Quickly tell 
      them what the site does (aims)</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Show them where 
      they are and how to move around (navigation)</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Appeal in a 
      sensory and/or emotional level (design/empathy/text - start the conversation)</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further into the 
  site, we may get more specific, by narrowing:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Search for 
      just one thing</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Read about 
      a single item</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Compare a list 
      of similar items</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With Amazon we 
  can see a 'conversation'. After the initial introductions and pleasentaries, 
  the user is invited to look through a number of categories by section. This 
  is like a good guide asking you what sort of thing you're after first (a book, 
  a CD), When you get to the right area, the focus narrows and you start looking 
  through the categories, either browsing or going for something exactly. Both 
  types of hunt are catered for (by category listings and by a search function). 
  When you have found something interesting you get to fucus down on that, and 
  find out what other people have thought about that book or CD or whatever. When 
  you decide to purchase, the whole thing narrows again (to the business of extracting 
  your credit card, address and so on). Finally you buy you're item. At any time 
  you are free to widen your focus again and 'jump back up the tree', or try something 
  different with a few well-guided clicks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This might seem 
  obvious, but it bears taking in: imagine you are actually talking and pointing 
  users around your site: what sort of tone is appropriate at what point? When 
  can you get technical and when generally pleasant? Good sites do exactly the 
  same thing, they just use different methods...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Instructions 
  </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another part of 
  this is issuing good instructions to users. Far from being dictatorial, you 
  really need to show people the way. In one study, people who were told to 'be 
  creative' on a brief did better than those without the instruction. Good instructions 
  have the following characteristics:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Purpose (Reason)</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Objective (Destination)</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Core (Procedure)</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Time (Duration)</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Expectation 
      (Anticipation)</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Failure (Error)</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consider the following:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Come to my house 
  on Friday for dinner at 7pm. I'm having an 'end of winter' party. My address 
  is 13 Wright St. The drive should take you 10 minutes from Kelburn. You need 
  to go up Taranaki St until you hit Massey, then keep an eye out on your right 
  for Monty St. Turn up it and then Wright St is first on your left. If you get 
  to the Drama School, you've gone too far! Bring a salad and a bottle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then consider these:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can be 
      assited if you cannot read (Ballot paper in US)</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hotel Shower 
      Cap in a box 'Fits One Head'</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sainsburies 
      Peanuts: Warnng, contains Nuts</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Xmas lights: 
      For indoor or outdoor use only</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You just have 
      to be nicer to me</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A<b>nd Questions</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the oldest 
  internet traditions is the FAQ page, where most asked questions are placed together 
  in a kind of rag-bag. This really just proves that the site doesn't work! Questions 
  need to be asked and answered in context. The answer can always be found, but 
  the art of asking the right question is rare. It can be a huge act of bravery 
  just to ask a simple question and happily admit yor ignorance. You can ask clients 
  simple direct questions that will help them and you in your work. It will save 
  you so much time it's not funny!</font></p>
