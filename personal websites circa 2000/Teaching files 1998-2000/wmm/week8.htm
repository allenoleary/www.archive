<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Character</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A character can 
  be anything from a person to a pencil, as long as it has personality, embodiment 
  and a function.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Characters perform 
  various functions in any media:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Allow us to 
    place ourselves in the events</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Represent various 
    ethical, emotional or conceptual views or states</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Provide texture, 
    setting, conflict</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Characters have 
  general parameters they share:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They want something 
    from their lives (super-objective)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They want something 
    in the piece we place them in (main line of action)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They want something 
    from beat to beat (objectives and actions)</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Characters are 
  not generally motivated by passive things, even if their aims are negative, 
  they want to achieve their aims. Desire is always a positive in that it leads 
  to action and it breaks down over several levels. Desire provokes action, and 
  contrary desires from various characters is conflict. Conflict itself in this 
  light doesn't mean beating each other up, it means what happens when two or 
  more active forces meet with differing goals. What happens then? Either someone 
  changes or the conflict deepens to it's logical extreme. These moments where 
  someone must change are often turning points in a drama - we want to see what 
  the character does in response to opposition.Often a character will change how 
  they act in a secxtion of a work, but will continue to pusue their major goals. 
  </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Exercise:</b> 
    Analyse an animation from both characters point of view and break down.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Exercise:</b> 
    Think about someone you know or that work colleague and see if you can break 
    it down: What do they want from life, from their job. Think about a situation 
    in which conflict was observed - was it resolved? Who backed down and why? 
    Did anyones goals actually change?</font></p>

</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Laban</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laban is a physical/kinaesthetic/emotive 
  scale for tracking and exploring character:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Direct/Indirect 
    (application of intention)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Broken/Sustained 
    (attention or focus)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Light/Heavy 
    (emotional weight)</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These make up 6 
  (very) basic types</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Slasher - indirect, 
    broken, heavy</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Dabber - direct, 
    broken, light</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Glider - direct, 
    sustained, light</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Presser - direct, 
    sustained, heavy</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Floater - indirect, 
    broken, light</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wringer - indirect, 
    sustained, heavy</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These can be combined 
  for more complex creations - for instance a Social Glider covering an Emotional 
  Slasher (American Psycho!!). It's these combinations which make a character 
  deep and compelling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On top of this 
  is added a physical center - what the character leads with.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Then there's 
  the 'givens'.</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Social Position</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Age</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sex</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Health</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Physique</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interesting characters 
  often 'go against', that is there will be interesting kinks or anomolies between 
  the physical/social/emotional charateristics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogue</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dialogue is not 
  natural, even when it seems that way. You have to choose the words to support 
  the whole person but also the action. The action is much more important!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Exercise:</b> 
  Write out a short scenario for two characters It should have the basic dramatic 
  shape:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A situation 
    that establishes two characters</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A revelation 
    of conflicting goals</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An escalation 
    of conflict</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A turning point</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A resolution</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then add the dialogue 
  and directions, page at the most.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Work on it with 
  a partner. </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clarify the 
    situation</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Read it aloud 
    playing the parts</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Refine the dialogue</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Point of View</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In RL (real life) 
  we have a constant Point of View and a constant, stable platform from which 
  to experience life - our body and stereoscopic vision. In literary terms, we 
  are all First Person all the time, occupying just the one body at a time. We 
  supplement our sense of being with our imaginations, and use other techniques 
  to allow us to identify with other people through the arts and film and so on, 
  but still we have only one body. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Often through life 
  we try and reinvent ourselves and make drastic changes to our superficial appearance 
  or our circumstances through other jobs or further education, but we are aware 
  that we take the whole lot (body, memories, prejudices) with us through life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> POV has always 
  been heavily tied to the interface or performative medium of a work: it is physically 
  not possible to have a first-person experience of a stage play for example, 
  you are always forced into the third person experience. In theatre this has 
  led to complicated narrative devices to develop empathy between the protagonist 
  and the audience member. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Likewise in Multimedia, 
  it's relatively easy to provide a first-person experience, but the visual nature 
  of the screen makes plain-text a dull experience, something it is not in a printed 
  novel, where the fluidity of the POV and narrators position - developed over 
  a few centuries now - is a high point of our culture. The oldest forms of enlarging 
  our own world view are the epic poem and the drama, and through drawing and 
  personal ornamentation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the centuries 
  literature and religion became the two best ways to allow identification with 
  others and, paradoxically, a way to leave our bodies and occupy other spaces, 
  at least temporarily. The invention of TV and film have enlarged the vocabulary 
  of drama and literature, but it's not until we got Multimedia that we see decisive 
  shift in the way that people experience other states of being in that the convergence 
  of media into one 'appliance' also merges the various ways that separate media 
  have mediated our presence in abstract or artificial realities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  When analysing and making Multimedia we need to ask ourselves several questions 
  about the relationship between the embodied reader/user, the virtual narrator/agent, 
  and the world of the piece. Assembling this information can be difficult because 
  Multimedia allows a larger variety of relationships than some media (such as 
  film), and can add other media together, leading to subversive and difficult 
  user/agent/world relationships. In fact it is often the invention of a new user/agent/world 
  scheme that makes a work important, rather than the works content. This is because 
  we are still trying to work out how interactive media works, and still expanding 
  the numbers and types of interfaces. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POV is usually 
  about the relationship between user and agent/world, rather than agent and world, 
  because the agent partakes of their virtual world in the same way that we partake 
  of ours: first person singular. It is the nature of the bridge between the user 
  and the avatar/world that is important. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Methods</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finding out more 
  about POV (do this in class with Allen)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 1. Make a list 
  of all the user position descriptions you can think of. What are the qualities 
  of each of the positions - how do they enhance the experience for the user, 
  or help them achieve their goals? Think about the qualities of empathy, immersion, 
  excitement, kinesthetic involvement, control, abstract thought, organisation, 
  problem solving. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. List some Multimedia 
  titles including games that you can think of or have played/owned. Group them 
  into 1st, 2nd and 3rd person user positions - does the user position change 
  in the course of a piece? If so, why? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Note down points 
  about each of the user positions, how does each title use user position as a 
  way to enhance it's appeal or message? How would each title be changed if the 
  user position were shifted to another? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Developing a User/Agent/World 
  schema - how do they interact and why? (do for your project) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The trick here 
  is to identify how the world, user and agent will be unified into a seamless 
  experience through the integration of the users task and the world by determining 
  both who the main agent is and then the relationship between the user and the 
  agent, and then the agent with the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Later on we develop 
  these ideas into an interface design. Consider the following points:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Refer back to the 
  aim of your piece and make a note of it. Look over your notes for the type of 
  world you are developing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You need to decide 
  who the main agent/agents are - who is it that is going to be the users representative 
  in this piece and why? Why this particular agent amongst the many in your world? 
  Does the user have one agent or can they switch, and if so, why?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Think of the type 
  of experience you are trying to get your user to have and see if any of the 
  POV's we have looked at and the types of experience they encourage make a good 
  fit. For instance, in an action piece you may choose a 1st person user/agent 
  relationship to heighten the excitement and experience of movement and action. 
  If your agent is considerably different from your target user in age or type, 
  you may want to use a 2nd person (avatar) relationship to encourage the user 
  to remember who the agent is (you might take this approach with a 'Little Red 
  Riding Hood' piece).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consider also the 
  role of time in your selection - how does time move in the game? Is it turn 
  based? Real time? Does time pass at all? · Do you need to offer the user opportunities 
  to shift from one user/agent/world position to another in the course of the 
  piece? In some games it is common to have 'command' screens where users can 
  select forces and then a playing screen which has a real time clock and an active 
  opponent. This sets different relationships between the modes: the first is 
  better for organisational thinking, while the second pressures the user into 
  action.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Think about all 
  the above points and write out a User/Agent/World schema by: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Identifying 
  the primary user goals </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Identifying 
  the primary agent/agents the user controls - why this/these particular agent? 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Noting the primary 
  relationship between the user and the agent in terms of POV - why choose this 
  relationship?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 4. Noting when 
  the POV relationship shifts and why. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From here we will 
  be ready to develop the main agents character and also extend our POV decisions 
  into an interface design. </font></p>
