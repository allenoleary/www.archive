      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Driven by the requirements 
        of industrial restructuring, perceived problems of government debt and 
        – more recently – international recession, governments over the last decade 
        have become more concerned with economic efficiency than during the ‘long 
        boom’ years of the postwar era. This is particularly the case with the 
        more market liberal societies such as Australia. Principles encompassed 
        by the term <i>efficiency</i> which have relevance for housing policy 
        include:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Privatisation, 
          which is premised on the assumption that private provision is more efficient 
          than government provision;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Targeting, which 
          requires identification of those in greatest need and targeting resources 
          specifically to such groups;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Market discipline, 
          which assumes that market prices will produce better decision making 
          by providing a measure of monetary discipline;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Visibility of 
          subsidies, which requires that any subsidy be easily identified and 
          costed, thereby facilitating financial accountability and responsibility;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Client accountability/consumer 
          sovereignty, which captures the idea that clients or consumers know 
          best their specific needs, thereby preventing inefficiencies created 
          by bureaucratic determination of need; and,</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Externalities, 
          which captures the idea that private and government actions have unanticipated 
          costs and benefits for the wider economy and society, and thereby measures 
          of efficiency extend beyond narrow accounting measures of costs.</font>
