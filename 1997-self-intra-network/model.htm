      <p> What's really interesting from a `self' point of view is <b>what happens 
        when we start to draw on the neural (network) aspect of interlinked computers, 
        and engage the networked, complex (chaotic) model, and apply these ideas

        is a reductive replacement of Deleuze and Guattari's `abstract machines'

      <p><b>1.The Clockwork Model.</b></p>
      <p>The chronometer was the scientific marvel of it's age. As well as allowing 
        voyages of discovery to pinpoint themselves accurately on the globe, <b>the 
        clock allowed accurate timing of all phenomenon and was the scientific 
        instrument par excellence of the Newtonian Age;</b> the clock allowed 
        things to be located in time as well as distance and using simple Cartesian 
        mapping's just about anything could be arranged with a new precision.</p>
      <p>De Landa examples the use of the clockwork paradigm in armies, where 
        the `rabble' could be drilled into army units that fought according to 
        a limited set of instructions. Units were given their orders and `set 
        off', their success relying heavily on the quality of the initial intelligence 
        directing them.</p>
      <p>`Clockwork' also becomes the dominant way of organising labour as well 
        as describing the laws of physics (where the world is `wound' with potential 
        energy - even entropy has an obvious link to the clockwork mechanism), 
        but also a common view of fate, and the inevitably of events </p>

        <b>2.The Motor Model.</b></p>
      <p>Using a military example we can see the deployment of the motor (in it's 
        earliest incarnation of the steam-engine) first occurring in Napoleonic 
        warfare. While Napoleon rejected the use of steam boats as a means for 
        invading England, he embraced the idea of a motor in his methodology of 
        war. </p>
      <p> While a clockwork mechanism directs energy along a predetermined path 
        until new energy is imparted to it, <b>the motor produces new motion within 
        itself; it uses a form of difference to extract energy from a reservoir 
        in accordance with a circulation diagram</b> <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">. 
        Thus army units were empowered to renew their orders independently of 
        a prime source. It's interesting that this new impetuous relies on soldiers 
        who are given more responsibility at a time when, fuelled (literally?) 
        by the revolution, the proletariat are gaining more say in politics, making 
        their patriotism the reservoir of the army.

        <p> <cite>"The new army is a mass army crushing the adversary under it's 
          weight in a permanent offensive, to the tune of the Marseillaise" </cite>(Charnot, 
          a French Mathematician). </p>

  <tr> 
    <td>Clearly, <b>the motor model also implies a new political and personal 
      model.</b> Fate becomes less predetermined; the writings of Rousseau on 
      education become wide spread and it becomes common place for people to reinvent 
      themselves, inserting themselves into the power machine where they serve 
      best, rather than where they were born to. 
      <p> Ideals become the individuals reservoir, the gap between the ideal and 
        the actual is the difference and personal action according to value systems 
        is the circulatory diagram. 
      <p> The motor model can be seen to be the underlying paradigm of many large 
        movements, from Marx to the free-wheeling industrial development of America, 
        they all tend to rest on different configurations of difference/reservoir/circulation.

    <td><b>3. The Network Model.</b> 
      <p> Again looking to the Military/Nation mix, Hitler's Germany is the leading 
        edge of the next model; that of the network. Even though the German war 
        machine was industrial, like Napoleon, <b>Hitler used next-paradigm ideas 
        to achieve an early advantage with the Blitzkrieg method of attack.</b> 
      <p> Even at the beginning of the war, Germany had far less tanks, planes 
        etc than England, but <b>what it had was a synergistic method born from 
        the unilateral belief in a New Germany</b>. In England the military machine 
        was (and still is) configured along class lines, various units and arms 
        of the war machine were unwilling to co-ordinate with others; this perhaps, 
        is the real reason the Americans won the war - the spirit of republic.

      <p> The critical intervention is the use of radio in a distributed command

        It was also <b>the first implementation of the network model, and is still 
        the dominant paradigm</b> <b>for making war</b> (and money and power-plays 
        et al) in this century, although this is set to change <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top"> 
      <p> Implicit in the blitzkrieg is <b>the new definition of `target'; in 
        a sense the material destroyed by the blitzkrieg was a stand in for the 
        morale of the leaders of the country, a deliberate attempt through shock 
        to put the enemies systems into a state of turbulence.</b> Likewise the 
        whole systemic understanding of the pressure group is founded on an identical 
        understanding; 
      <blockquote> <cite>"....the function of the artillery and infantry will 
        be taken over, in the future, by propaganda" </cite>Hitler<cite>. </cite> 
      </blockquote>
      <p> In this there is the understanding of the `a butterfly can create a 
        storm' platitude of chaos theory, which is the correlate of the network 
        model.
