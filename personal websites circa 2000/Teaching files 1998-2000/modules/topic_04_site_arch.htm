        Introduction to site architecture</b></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information 
          design is nothing new. The Novel or enclyclopedia have very resolved 
          and conventional information designs. (We'll have a look at those in 
          class). Most of these conventions are to do with the handling of spatial 
          layout. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The crucial 
          difference between say book design and site design is that site design 
          uses both space and time to acheive it's effects: Consider a building 
          - not only to the architects have to think about the spatial relationships 
          and functions of the volumes, but also how people will move through 
          those volumes. Much effort goes into enabling people to get around the 
          building in a logical and/or aesthetically pleasing way. Signage is 
          a big deal in itself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Think about 
          the Melbourne Casino. The shopping strip that runs the north side of 
          the ground floor is essentially modelled on a traditional city. Shops 
          line each side of the progressional throughfare, just like a conventional 
          street, while the food court tries to mirror the idea of a town square. 
          Shops are organised around a peripheral edge, facing in to the central 
          space. They've got it a bit wrong, becasue there is usually a central 
          focus in a town square (a band rotunda, fountain or water pump), but 
          in the Casino the central space is occupied by a lift and escalators.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New Media 
          is beginning to have some conventions of it's own (top banner, navigation 
          on the left-hand side, flat and deep structures).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is 
          also a growing cross-over between the web and other information rich 
          environments like a newspaper. We'll take a look at that, and get the 
          information order/visual order idea in our heads.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The 
        Site Map</b></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The site 
          map is a graphical representation of the sites structure. It is not 
          dissimilar to an architects floor plan. With a floor plan we look to 
          see how much space each room has, as well as the possible pathways that 
          we might travel through those spaces. Likewise with a site map it should 
          clearly indicate the following things:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">What 
            the first page of your site is</font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">(entrance 
            way)</font>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">What 
            major sectional divisions exist in the information you are presenting, 
            and how large each section is (volume)</font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Major 
            pathways through your site (hallways and transitional spaces)</font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The 
            position of each page on your site in the information architecture 
            (plan) </font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Some

      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chunking</font></b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chunking 
          is the process of breaking information into appropriate sizes so it 
          maintains its integrity and legibility. In print media the paragraph 
          is the primary way of controlling informational chunks. In new media 
          it tends to be the screen.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The best 
          way to understand this is to do it:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>'The 
          Exciting world of brewing Tea' (the website)</b></font></p>

            map</font></li>

            branching</font></li>
