      the world-type that your grandparents grew up in are very different from 
      the one that you or I grew up in. Viewed broadly in the historical epoch 
      of the the last two millenia, there are (according to Manuel De Landa) three

    <td><b>The Fascist/Anarchic Duality</b> 
      <p> Creation of Identity in the Network mode requires articulation in line 
        with the dominant useful construct of the time; Chaos theory, where the 
        subject is always under the sway of strange attractors. <b>The two basic 
        attractors are the Fascist attractor and the Anarchic attractor.</b> 
      <p> In a basic form the two attractors work across an axis that has `i am 
        like this' at one end and `i am not like anything' at the other. <b>At 
        their most extreme they represent the completely static subject and the 
        completely mobile subject; Hitler youth or Insanity plus.</b> In reality 
        we tend to inhabit more of the former with gestures towards the later. 
        The straight businessman who has a penchant for crazy ties, the artist 
        who aims to paint like a child or with an edge of `madness'. <b>The irony 
        of the fascist attractor is that it cleanly reincorporates statements 
        about the self; to say `i am different' is to reinsert yourself in the 
        fascist attractor with greater force</b>, all you are accomplishing is 
        becoming the same in your difference. To name or to define is to categorize 
        yourself with more vigor. This is the process of returning to a null state. 
        This is why <b>the fascist attractor always needs the anarchic attractor; 
        as a source of energy.</b>

    <td><b>Anarchy and the rebound effect.</b> 
      <p> Unfortunately, <b>just heading out wholesale for the anarchic attractor 
        will not benefit you either</b>; if you hold open the gap between self 
        and naming for too long you will literally drive yourself mad. Going one 
        way to an extreme will bounce you back (`reform') or break you up... 
      <p> It is along the Fascist/Anarchic axis that Freud worked his magic, reordering 
        the anarchy of psychic illness back into the same/difference attractor. 
        It is also <b>this axis which defines modernism;</b> from the programmatic 
        projects of Le Corbusier, the fluctuations of capital and the failure 
        of radical political groups <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;to 
        the discovery of nuclear fusion, the movement is played out on this line.

    <td><b>Moving sideways into Amerika</b> 
      <p> <b>The network, however, adds the possibility of allowing further attractors 
        into the mix, turning the modern into post-modern, and adding new complexities. 
        </b> 
      <p> One of the new, and most prevalent, attractors is one that occurs in 
        writers of the deconstructionist school, or at least those of a particularly 
        `clever' bent like Paul de Mann; <b>this new attractor is perhaps best 
        labelled simply `Amerika', as it achieves it's apogee in America</b>, 
        especially in the writings of the fascinated forgeiner, Baudrillard. 
      <p> Very briefly, the logic goes like this: <b>everything is more or less 
        horizontally configured</b>, slippage between sign and referant guarantees 
        a lack of verticality (meaning). <b>Therefore the journeys sideways, inherently 
        deprived of meaning, become the point;</b> a decentered `having', whether 
        of experience or things or knowledge, becomes more important than `naming', 
        since naming is now seen to be reductionist and perilous. <b>So Amerika 
        is a attractor which can also go under the title `shopping-to-be' and 
        is an advanced form of tourism <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" align="top"></b> 
      <p> The dangers of Amerika are two fold: 
      <p> <b>1: First</b>, <b>the lack of verticality makes for a kind of fascinated 
        hopelessness</b> as the `end of history' is a place where everyone wants 
        to catch up with America (literally) at the attractor of Amerika into 
        a higher synthesis. As a writer at the time of the French revolution said:.. 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><cite>"The annihilation of the negative in the negation of the negative, 
          the presence of truth and the truth of presence. However, it it also 
          the apogee of non-meaning. For there is nothing left to be done (therefore 
          all action is absurd), nor anything left to be said (therefore all speech 
          is insignificant). <b>At the end of history, the human species enters 
          into an irredeemable idleness, an aimlessness without end."</b></cite><b><br>
          <br>
          Descombes, </b>a French mathematician<b>.</b> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>2</b>: <b>Second; if everything is indeed idleness and action ceases 
        to have importance, then the subject can do anything and exalt in the 
        very things that, thirty years ago, would have been considered outrageous.<img src="goside.gif" width="85" height="20" border="0" align="top"></b> 
      </p>
      <p> So, on the one hand the Fascist/Anarchic attractor, then moving away 
        from it is the `shopping to be' tangent. All in all not pleasing choices...
