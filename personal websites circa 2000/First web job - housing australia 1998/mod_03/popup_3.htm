        Housing Stock types</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Another major characteristic 
        of the Australian social housing system is the type of stock. Where in 
        most countries this is multi-unit housing, often high rise, the bulk of 
        the Australian stock is detached housing, much of it on broad acre estates 
        in the middle ring suburbs and outer areas of the cities. There is some 
        high rise, mainly in the inner areas of Melbourne and Sydney, but such 
        estates do not have the same problems as equivalent stock overseas.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Other distinctive 
        aspects of the Australian social housing system include:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The subsidy to 
          households in the form of a rebate on rents provided by the housing 
          agencies themselves, rather than a rent supplement from some central 
          government agency; <b>Link C2</b></font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Market rent, not 
          cost rent; <b>Link C3</b></font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">An allocation 
          system increasingly targeted at special needs, rather than low income 
          or inability to access private rental; <b>Link C4</b></font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The emergence 
          of a national social housing reform agenda in the 1990s; <b>Link C5 
          </b>and, </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The sales policy 
          of the 1960s and 1970s, long preceding the Thatcher government’s sell-off. 
          <b>Link C6</b></font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The small size of 
        the sector, along with its other distinctive features, has created a complex
