<h1>Making a Basic Page</h1>

<h3>Using 'View Source'</h3>

<p>Use the 'View Source' option on your browser to look the underlying html of this page. Then type up something similar in an html or text editor and view it in a browser.</p>

<h3>See how the content shifts?</h3>

<p>One of the first principles of web design is that the content shifts to fit the browser window of the client/user who is viewing the page. Try it yourself. Grab one of the browsers resize handles and drag the browsers window left and right. You should see that this paragraph moves in and out to fit the window.</p>

<p>This is one of html's biggest strengths and also one of the most frustrating things in the world for web designers, specially if they have a print background - it's difficult to get the content to look good across browsers, screen sizes and platforms.</p>
