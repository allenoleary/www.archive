          <h4>Since 1997</h4>
          <p>Initially I learned how to make websites out of a very large book. There were no courses and not many people around to help. The internet was dial-up, there weren't any online data bases, it was a 'find-and-replace' world. I started knocking up websites adn flash animations for the University, then a very early digital agency. In the late nineties I wrote and delivered some of the earliest web design courses in Australia.</p>

          <h4> Design</h4>

          <p>Thankfully things have moved on a lot since then. Sometimes things got easier (with content management systems) then they get harder again (ecommerce) then easier (blogging) then harder (mobile). It's a world that I enjoy and excel in. Web design now exists at an intersection between techncial, creative and business skills. You have to understand the buiness as much as html and css and psychology to deliver a good site.</p>

          <p>As well as my <a href="ia-ux-content.html">excellent IA/UX skills</a> I am a repsonsive friendly html3, css3 coder and tend to design elegant but high-impact sites.</p>

          <h4>Drupal</h4>
<p>While I am comfortable with coding for any CMS I do have a very good understanding of Drupal. I've been using it for over six years and have delivered a good number of sites on it. It certainly has its quirks but for a combinaiton of power and flexibility it is very good.</p>
