<h2 tabindex="1">Introduction</h2>
<p>Here is a brief description of my research interests as I gear up to an MA, 
  and continue (as ever) my personal research for my writing: </p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#1" tabindex="1">Writing with the Set </a></li>
  <li><a href="#2" tabindex="2">Chora</a></li>
  <li><a href="#3" tabindex="3"> The Line and the Fold</a></li>
  <li><a href="#4" tabindex="4"> Warfare, technology and the male </a></li>
</ol>
<h3 tabindex="5"><a name="1" id="1"></a>1 "Writing with the Set; Creative Strategies for Network 
  Writing." </h3>
<p>This is the nominal title of my yet-to-be-tackled MA. Here's a brief description: 
</p>
<p>In the course of this MA I propose to define, research, analyse and demonstrate 
  various creative approaches to the practice of writing under the paradigm of 
  the Network. </p>
<p>I will be looking to see if there are definable features and similarities in 
  the creative and theoretical approaches of artists to various forms of Network 
  Writing. </p>
<p>I will do this through the description and analysis of a range of Network pieces, 
  working in to see if there is any common ground. I will also work out from a 
  generative idea and make a number of Network pieces in various forms to further 
  test any conclusions I may reach. </p>
<p>The works I will study are across a range of media and delivery systems, some 
  are 'traditional' (static) and others are iterative, but all have the kind of 
  approach I think defines 'writing the set'. </p>
<ul>
  <li>'Heuretics' by Gregory Ulmer </li>
  <li>'Parc de Villette' Tschumi, Eisemann and Derrida </li>
  <li>'Iconica' Troy Innocent</li>
  <li> 'Blade Runner' Westwood Software </li>
  <li>'Pale Fire' Vladimir Nabokov</li>
  <li> 'The Black Sequin Dress' Jenny Kemp</li>
  <li> 'Theatre of the Oppressed' by Augusto Boal </li>
</ul>
<p>I will draw on a range of critical approaches in my description and analysis 
  of works and approaches, from codex based textual analysis (particularly the 
  poststructural movement), media theory, hypertext scholarship, and traditional 
  rhetoric. I will also be looking at information theory, particularly approaches 
  to genetic and parallel computing as well as database manipulation, which will 
  be relevant to an understanding of Network approaches to knowledge representation. 
</p>

<h3 tabindex="7"><a name="2" id="2"></a>2 Chora </h3>
<p>Originally sourced from "Timeus" by Plato, the Chora is described as a third 
  type of nature between those of being and becoming. It's a slippery concept 
  that evokes the receptive space of creation. In Derrida's words, Chora is </p>
<p>"irreduclible to the two positions, the sensible and the intelligble, which 
  have dominated the entire tradition of Western thought, it is irreducible to 
  all the values to which we are accustomed... Chora receives everything or gives 
  place to everything... it is absolutely blank, evreything that is printed on 
  it is automatically effaced. " </p>
<p>It is a kind of reflective dimension of creative thought, a place where impossible 
  things can be joined because nothing is represented there. </p>
<p>The concept of Chora interests me because it is an attempt to allow a space 
  beyond analysis, the kind of space that Artists use routinely and yet receives 
  little or no critical attention. Because it is beyond analysis and can only 
  be partially apprehended though extended metaphor, it's not exactly a 'proveable' 
  phenomenon. By switching attention to the 'network' aspect of it's being, and 
  by using concepts of hybid space, I hope to see how it can be used as a tool/mystery 
  in creative work for the 21st C.</p>
<p> <a href="#top" tabindex="8">top of page</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="9"><a name="3" id="3"></a>3 The Line and the Fold </h3>
<p>I use this oppositionary phrase to locate an ancient antagonism between various 
  binary pairs: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The clean mathematical vector versus the messy emperic (Copernicus versus 
    Keppler?)</li>
  <li> The desire for pure speed versus the necessity of the organic (VR versus 
    RL) </li>
  <li>The organised and oiled versus the chaotic and dirty (Armies defeted by 
    Guerillas)</li>
</ul>
<p> Of course the formulation is not my own, and derives from various works by 
  Virilio, Deleuze (in his study of the Baroque initially) and DeLanda. What great 
  writers... </p>
<p><a href="#top" tabindex="10">top of page</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="4"><a name="11" id="4"></a>4 Warfare, technology and the male </h3>
<p>I must confess to having an unhealthy interest in Warfare. Maybe because my 
  generation has 'missed out'. Maybe because my Grandfather went. Maybe becasue 
  I used to spend hours as a kid trying to figure out ways to play wargames by 
  myself (the dilemnas of the only child!). Mostly I think because it's where 
  the applcation of technology is at it's most extreme, and because some of the 
  best books on technology I've read have been about war ('Warfare in the Age 
  of Intelligent Machines' by Manuel De Landa is my favourite). </p>
<p>Also in the last decade of the last century we spent so much time watching 
  American trying to make War clean, like a foregone conclusion, like an advertising 
  campaign. We know the reality is extreme and costly in so many ways, mostly 
  to the men who still have to fight them, and, of course, the 'colateral damage'. 
  Today, more American GI's have died early from taking their own lives than lost 
  their lives in the conflict. </p>
<p>My latest play 'Fond Love and Kisses' is set in NZ during WWII, and revolves 
  around a well hidden set of events called 'the furlough incident'. A whole heap 
  of volunteers of '39 came home for a rest in '43. Looking arounf them they saw 
  a coutry which had no real idea of the realities of the war, they saw men making 
  profits and taking it easy - and many of the soldiers decided not to go back 
  to war. The Governement (ironically, the Labout Party) put a media blackout 
  on the whole thing, and despite several protest marches, court martialled all 
  soldiers who refused to disembark again in '44.</p>
