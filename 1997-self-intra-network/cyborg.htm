      <b>The End of Humanity?</b> 
      <p> <b>Like most other `endings' like the death of God, Truth, History, 
        the end of the human is a poetic way of saying that a pardigm line, a 
        phase shift, has been passed. </b> It's much nicer to write that `God 
        is dead' rather than `The dominant structuring of the world is no longer 
        measured against the objective category of God' - it's a question of style, 
        which is no empty matter. 
      <p> <b>Humanity - the Enlightenment project - has been made a sub-category 
        of nostalgia within the machine of the pan-capitalists</b>&nbsp;<img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0"
	  align="top"> and the process of prescience has been left to `crack-pots' 
        like&nbsp;para-psychics, cult leaders. The End of Humanity, while sounding 
        scary, marks a shift and not an absolute. If `modern' civilisation can 
        be seen as a product of the Enlightenment and the rise of `the power to 
        be one', <b>then the current shift suggested by the phrase `Posthuman' 
        takes us into uncharted waters; the power to be many.</b>

    <td><b>The Posthuman Cyborg</b> 
      <p> The assembling of the words `cyber' and `organism' nicely shows the 
        forces at work here. `Cyber' is from Cybernetics, the study of communication 
        patterns, robotics and data-space. `Organism' is an interesting choice, 
        it already assumes that `human' is merely one case of `organism', and 
        not a privileged case at that. <b>So Cyborg does not even necessarily 
        include `human', or only as one possible instance. </b> 
      <p> As mentioned `above' in notes on Manuel Delandas work&nbsp;<img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top"> 
        <b>it's conceivable to see the development of the human as a first stage 
        in the evolution of robots or Cyborgs.</b> It has been proved theoretically 
        that machines are capable of reproducing through machines, that they can 
        assemble themselves in processes independently of human input. With the 
        advent of artificial tissue and bone growth (a recent development) there 
        is no reason at all why such an `ubercyborg' race could not develop. The 
        subject has been extensively examined in fiction and film, perhaps the 
        most notable example being the blockbuster Terminator series.

    <td><b>Theory into Practice</b>. 
      <p> The cyborg principle is well under way to becoming reality. The Military 
        machine has the most to benefit here, and the creation of the `wired' 
        soldier is only one step off being a true cyborg in that the grunt can 
        take the stuff off at the end of the day. It's debatable whether, while 
        he's packing the gear, a grunt is a cyborg, but certainly it's getting 
        close. My main point is, however, that <b>the cyborg is an ellision between 
        the machine and the organism, in much the same way as the self is an ellision 
        between identity and the network; it's a phase shift into a new space, 
        and it certainly has the potential to leave the `human' well behind.</b> 
        Whether you think this is great and think that the unaugmented body has 
        had it's day <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;or 
        not is kind of irrelevant unless you're active in the feild in a practical 
        or theoretical way. Opposing the cyborg principle is like trying to outlaw 
        modern art, try it if you can... better to be on the inside perhaps, to 
        join the `Virtual Class?'.

    <td><b>The Will to Virtuality.</b> 
      <p> Arthur Kroker and Micheal Weinstein, in their book "Data Trash", assert 
        the existence of a <b>`Virtual Class', those who are connected and have 
        the `will to virtuality'</b>. In their world, the Cyborg is only a step 
        along the way to the desire for a purely virtual being, an effort to escape 
        the `meat' of the human flesh entirely. 
      <p> Among their striking observations of a post-human future, they identify 
        the modern/Pomo histories as those of a `culture of recline', a laying 
        down to the ultimate virtual species that we have been the `gene' pool 
        for. <b>Relating their ideas to some of mine `above', the will to virtuality 
        is a strange mutation of the fascist attractor. </b>If, in Nazi Germany, 
        the people were willing to bear the weird constructions of the state - 
        the patchwork of myth, technological brilliance and perfect marketing 
        - in order to get their paradise (and by implication necessitate an arbitrary 
        `other'), then what does the our conception of a virtual paradise mean? 
        <b>Are we in the process of empowering a `Virtual Fuhrer', a post-human 
        one, whose mandate allows it to use <i>us</i> as `the other'?</b> 
      <p>If this is so then it's a very weird topology in which we are both the 
        people AND the enemy. <b>Are we so disgusted with ourselves that we need 
        make ourselves obsolete?</b> Do we have to sacrifice ourselves to get 
        a better life?
