        Ongoing Reforms and Problems</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the 1990s the 
        social housing sector was the subject of a number of reforms, due to its 
        endemic problems, including:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The huge waiting 
          list, which throughout the 1990s exceeded the number of vacant properties 
          by a ratio of four to one (Australia-wide there are roughly 220,000 
          applicants on the waiting list, and only 50,000 dwellings become available 
          each year, mainly through re-lets);</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The dominance 
          of pensioners and beneficiaries, with the outcome of 83 per cent of 
          all tenants being on subsidised or rebated rents (DSS 1998). The increasing 
          liability, combined with contracting Commonwealth outlays to the States, 
          means a decline in SHA revenues to the degree that their financial viability 
          is at ris<font color="#FF0000">k; <b>See C2</b></font></font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The aging of the 
          stock, with the associated problems of repair and redevelopment needs. 
          This is a problem of inadequate past maintenance, poor quality of construction 
          during the 1950s and the sale of the best quality stock in the 1970s;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The concentration 
          of much of the stock on large outer urban estates and in provincial 
          towns (almost all in the form of detached housing) where there were 
          limited labour market opportunities due to economic restructuring which 
          bore disproportionately on these areas. This problem thrust to the fore 
          issues of client choice and portability of housing subsidies so that 
          people, in theory, could move to where the jobs are;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The perceived 
          mismatch in stock, that is, small households occupying largish dwellings 
          when more rent could be extracted if larger households were moved into 
          such properties;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The horizontal 
          inequity issue, that is, low income households in the private rental 
          sector were perceived to get considerably less housing assistance through 
          rent assistance than public sector households through their rebates. 
          The argument was put that eligible public tenants received on average 
          $3,000 of subsidy, while eligible private tenants received only $1,000. 
          In fact, the difference is nowhere near as marked, as the average is 
          affected by the enormously high rebates in Sydney as a result of it 
          having the rent structures typical of global cities like London, New 
          York or Paris. Stripped of the Sydney effect, there is a lesser horizontal 
          inequity problem; and,</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A perception in 
          many quarters that the monolithic SHAs were poor housing managers, insensitive 
          to clients’ needs, unimaginative in policy directions and broadly unaccountable. 
          </font></li>
      </ul>

        nature of the reforms and the principles on which they are based are outlined
