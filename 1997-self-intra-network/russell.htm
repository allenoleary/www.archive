      <b>Life</b>
      <p>
      Russell was one of the founding influences in the development of analytical
      philosophy and was primarily concerned with <b>the foundational logic behind
      mathematics.</b> 
      <p>
      As well as contributing to philosophical life, he was an active teacher and
      political campaigner, especially against nuclear weapons. A controversial
      figure. He ran as a suffragette member for parliament, was imprisoned during
      the first world war for stating that American soldiers would be used as strike
      breakers in England, just like they were at home. <b>He was refused a teaching
      post in the 30's at New York Uni on the grounds that his works were `lecherous,
      libidinous, lustful, venerous, erotomaniac, aphrodisiac, irreverent,
      narrow-minded, untruthful and bereft of Moral fibre.'</b> He was awarded
      the Nobel Prize for literature in 1950.
      <p>
      It's generally held that his best work was done in the first two decades
      of the century where he examined theories of description, truth and experience,
      and the logical under-pinning of mathematics (the use of set theory to teach
      math is a direct ancestor of Russell's work).

    <td><b>Russell's Paradox</b>
      <p>
      .For our purposes, one of Russell's most interesting formulations was `Russell's
      Paradox'. That is, <b>if there is a Set of all sets, then does it contain
      itself?</b> Russell's proof that the answer changes over time - that the
      answer is both yes and no depending on how far through the logic you go -
      gives rise to the idea of an algorithm, or computational procedure, which
      Turing used as the basis of the Turing Machine. <b>Algorithms are the basis
      of computer programming,</b> and their reliance on an underlying argumentative
      logic makes them a `logic prosthetic', rather than a transcendental class
      of their own - no matter how hard we try...
