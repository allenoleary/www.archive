      <b>Enigma.</b> 
      <p> An English Mathematician, <b>Turing is probably most famous as the breaker 
        of the `Enigma' code used by the Germans during WWII</b>. 
      <p> <b>During this period he realised that the hard-wired computers he was 
        using could potentially be redesigned to be flexible electronic computational 
        devices</b>. 
      <p> His breakthrough was to introduce a read/write function to the machine, 
        and he boiled down the required algorithms to make such a machine possible 
        to five in number. This is known as the Turing Machine, and is capable 
        of calculating Recursive functions. In effect he made a set of algorithm 
        notated and expressed precisely enough to be used in computations.

    <td><b>`Passing'.</b> 
      <p> Also of interest is <b>the `Turing Test' which is an experiential test 
        for judging whether a machine is making an adequate simulation of the 
        human mind. </b>An interrogator `quizes' both a machine and a person. 
        The machine passes if, after a period of time, the interrogator cannot 
        distinguish between the human and the machine. He thought this would be 
        accomplished within tens years - that is, by 1960 - but it's doubtful 
        whether this test could yet be passed by an AI machine. 
      <p> The seldom mentioned sexualised aspect of the Turing test is interesting. 
        <b>In the initial essay where Turing comes up&nbsp;with the idea of the 
        Turing test, the&nbsp;object of the test is&nbsp;for the interogater to&nbsp;decide 
        which `source' is a woman.</b> Therefore to `pass' the test is to erase 
        sexual difference. Is it surprising that Turing, who&nbsp;was later discredited 
        by the British Government on account of his homosexuality, should configure 
        the test this way?
