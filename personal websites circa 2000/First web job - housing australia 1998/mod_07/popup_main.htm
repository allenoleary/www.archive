        1. The Dominance of the Market in the Production and Allocating of Housing

      <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#cc3300"><b>The 
        Context of Housing Provision</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All countries must 
        grapple with management of a diverse range of economic, social and environmental 
        demands. To this effect, <i>all countries have evolved a particular approach 
        to the management of these demands. The Australian approach reflects our 
        particular economic structure and social and political heritage</i>. It 
        is an approach which is far from universal in its principles and characteristics. 
        Other countries have approaches which range from very similar to markedly 
        different. This will have major repercussions for the form of housing 
        and housing policy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While all countries 
        are different, many do share general attributes, and it is possible to 
        aggregate them even if it is in a rough and ready form. One categorisation 
        is in terms of those which are <i>market liberal</i> and others which 
        are <i>social democratic. </i>The former share a greater emphasis on the 
        market; they value individualism, consumer choice and self-help and have 
        lower taxes and a smaller role of government. Labour markets and financial 
        markets tend to be less regulated, and industry protection is lower. Australians 
        have coined the term <i>economic rationalist</i> for this form of society. 
        Australia, along with the United States and New Zealand, are market liberal 
        or economic rationalist societies. Social democratic societies, while 
        still market societies, place a greater emphasis on government, have higher 
        taxes and share values of community and communitarianism. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The market liberal 
        institutional arrangement, along with the policies and values that go 
        with it, explains some of the distinctive features of the Australian housing 
        system such as the low proportion of social housing and the dominance 
        of home ownership. Among other things it is also a cause of higher levels 
        of poverty than in social democratic societies – a factor that places 
        considerable stress on the small social housing sector. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Another key feature 
        of the Australian institutional structure is its federal system of governance. 
        The federation of the colonies in 1901 created a constitutional environment 
        with significant implications for the housing system. The federal constitution 
        has meant that most of the laws applying to housing – for example, residential 
        tenancy legislation, property law, building regulations and planning controls 
        – are State or local government based, with the States protecting their 
        rights vigorously. Unlike in the United States or Canada, there is no 
        largish federal agency responsible for policy directions in housing, with 
        the result that there is nothing which resembles an Australian housing 
        policy. The Commonwealth, however, has historically had taxing powers 
        and therefore most of the revenue. Thus, while States and local government 
        – particularly the former – provide or set the context for housing provision, 
        arrangements have had to be made with the Commonwealth for funding.<br>
