        Drama and Happenings.</b> 
      <p> <b>A plateau is perhaps best defined by what it is not; as a state of 
        being it is fundamentally opposed to a humanist point of view; that is 
        it does not rely on concepts of subject like conflict, resolution, climax.</b> 
        These concepts can be generally grouped under hierachies, or directory 
        `trees' and are structured by definition according to type. In The Drama 
        (from Aristotle to Stanislavski to the Hollywood feature film) a character 
        in drama has these salient features: a conflict to resolve, sets of crisis's 
        to pass through, a climactic event where some kind of action must be taken, 
        and finally a reintegration of new material with their life. <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;The 
        whole concept of Plateau enters The Drama from eastern sources, most emphatically 
        in the theatrical work of Antonin Artaud &nbsp;<img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top"> 
        who used models from Balinese and Oriental theatre to begin his writing 
        on the `Theatre of Cruelty' where <b>events, rather than being developed 
        and resolved, are multiplied and catastrophic;</b> the aleatory suspensions 
        of `happenings' versus the wisdom of Oedipus Rex (or sundry Hollywood 
        heroes).<br>

    <td><b>Raga.</b>
      <p>
      Perhaps the cleanest example of plateau structures is in Indian classical
      music where <b>the mode, melody and ornamentation are favoured over the harmonic
      structure of the (western) sonata form.</b> In contemporary popular music
      this difference is audible between song forms and `texture' forms like trance,
      electro or techno where the DJ creates an intensity from groupings of individual
      pieces which in themselves may have no `development'. At a very basic level
      plateau versus rise-to-climax has a correlation in reductionist views of
      female/male sexuality.

    <td><b>Self and Plateau.</b>
      <p> <b>The plateau is a `stable disequilibrium', the area of ordered turbulence 
        in chaos theory, before the bifurcation or phase shift, before the event 
        is seized by new strange attractors.</b> Plateaus are `consistencies' 
        created in networks that are articulated by non-hierachical links called 
        (in Deleuze and Guatarri) `rhizomes' <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp; 
        A consistency may mix elements of the real, the virtual, the abstract, 
        treating them all as equal in the functioning of the abstract machine. 
        <b>Persona is such a consistency, occurring between the self and the socius, 
        and can be formulated by hierachical ordering or conjunctive plateau intensities.</b>
