      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Most advanced industrial 
        countries have experienced eroding affordability over the last decade, 
        and the provision of affordable housing is a major objective. Unfortunately, 
        the articulation of an objective does not ensure success in addressing 
        it, as few countries appear to have made major inroads into improving 
        affordability despite major policy reforms. However, any discussion of 
        affordability problems requires some specification of the affordability 
        concept and what a problem represents. Thus, in Australia, we may complacently 
        accept that housing costs, on average, only consume 12.6 per cent of household 
        income and therefore conclude that there is no affordability problem. 
        The issue in Australia, as in all advanced industrial nations, is not 
        whether there is a general affordability problem, but whether there is 
        one for specific groups and whether the trend is towards continued erosion 
        of affordability for such groups.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Affordability is 
        principally a problem for newly forming households beginning their housing 
        careers, for single income households (mainly single parents and single 
        persons) and for groups who, for whatever reason, have low incomes. Typically, 
        the measure of housing affordability is some yardstick criteria of housing 
        costs as a proportion of income, such as not more than 20, 25 or 30 per 
        cent. The greater the number exceeding the yardstick, the greater the 
        affordability problem. The evidence from virtually all countries reviewed 
        shows that the numbers experiencing such a problem are growing. Housing 
        policy reform is increasingly being shaped by an awareness of this.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">However, the degree 
        to which housing affordability is being experienced as a problem depends 
        on the existing character of the housing market, the form and degree of 
        government intervention (including comprehensiveness of welfare programs) 
        and the state of the economy. It would appear that affordability is more 
        of a problem in countries with a small social housing sector – and, conversely, 
        private market dependence – and leaner welfare systems. Thus, the problem 
        appears less intense in Germany and Denmark.</font></p>
