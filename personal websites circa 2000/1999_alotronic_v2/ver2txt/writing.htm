<p>'Deviations' gets some development Money</p>
 
  <p>After the frustrations of 1999, it's nice to get some development money for 
    'Deviations'. Elbow Theatre, an up and coming company form Canberra applied 
    to Arts ACT for two weeks of developement money for 'Deviations'. The time 
    and locality have yet to be arranged, but I hope that a workshop will lead 
    to a production. </p>
<p>'Ride on Time' gets a recording</p>
 
  <p>After years of mucking around (four to be exact!) 'Ride on Time' a radio 
    play for Radio NZ, has finally been recorded. Stephan Danby took the play 
    into the Studio with a great cast, and should be putting all the noises in 
    soon.</p>
<p>'Burnt' called off</p>
 
  <p>After much reading and soul searching, Evan and I decided that there wasn''t 
    enough good material to warrant going to the effort of doing the production 
    at LaMama, and have cancelled the project.</p>

<p>Deviations a near miss at Playbox</p>
 
  <p>After lots of good noise, Deviations got knocked back for the short season 
    of up and coming writers at Playbox in 2000. However I did do a useful rewrite 
    after some good advice from Tom Healey (Acting Associate Artistic Director). 
    Also recieved some very positive feedback (but again, no production) form 
    the Griffin Theatre in Sydney. It is still lurking somewhere in Jane Waddells 
    plans for Circa Studio...</p>
<p>Burnt @ LaMama</p>
 
  <p>Evan Watts and I had this idea that we might do an evenng of themed short 
    plays at LaMama. The plays would be from 3 seconds to 3 minutes long and respond 
    to the provocation 'Burnt'. We have convinced Liz Jones at LaMama that it's 
    a good idea, so have to find the plays now. We advertised through the Various 
    State Writers Centres, and the ANPC's magazine.</p>

<h3><a name="1998" id="1998"></a>1998</h3>
<p> Deviations (aka &quot;As If We Could Be Normal&quot;) read at Downstage and 
  LaMama</p>
 
  <p>Within the space of three weeks 'Devaitions' got two play readings, one as 
    part of the Adams Playreading Season (run by Playmarket NZ) and the other 
    organised and directed by Evan Watts at LaMama. </p>
  <p>I got a video of the Wellington reading (directed by Jane Waddell and with 
    a cast including Victor Rodger, Cameron Rhodes and Anna McPhail) and quickly 
    rewrote it for the LaMama reading. The LaMama reading went very well, with 
    a nice full audience including many from my Writing class. The cast was James 
    Laidlaw, David Treddenick, Zoe Burton and .</p>

<h3><a name="1997" id="1997"></a> 1997</h3>
<p>Reading at Playwrights in the Raw</p>
 
  <p>I read 'A Holden '68 Special' in an afternoon of playwrights reading their 
    own works in Playboxes 'Writers in the Raw'season.</p>
<p>A Poem published in &quot;Mutes and Eartquakes&quot;</p>
 
  <p>Bill Manhire, the Vic Uni lecturer for the 'Creative Writing' Course at Vic 
    Uni, included a poem of mine (from 1986...) in his anthology of best works 
    from the Course. The poem &quot;for the old&quot; I wrote at the fresh age 
    of 18. Not very notable in itself, but the only poetry I've had published 
    so far, not that I ever tried very hard...</p>

<h3><a name="1996" id="1996"></a>1996</h3>
<p>'The Vampyre Dances' premieres at Circa Theatre</p>
 
  
<p>Directed by Murray Lynch and with an excellent cast, my first solo stage play 
  premiered at Circa on the main stage. I returned to NZ for 6 weeks to 'help'put 
  this on (That means stay out of the way and attend publicty interviews!). </p>

<h3><a name="1995" id="1995"></a>1995</h3>
<p>'The Vampyre Dances' in Oceania Playwrights Workshop</p>
 
  <p>Directed by Lisa Warrington (who used to teach me at Otago Uni) and dramaturged 
    by the excellent Simon O'Connor. This play caused lots of controversy at the 
    conference on account of appropriation issues. While I wrote it as a satire 
    on land rights (and very critical of the pakeha) it came in for a lot of attention 
    from Maori actors in the cast. I made substantial changes to the script and 
    was seen by some to be 'giving in' to racial pressure. I even heard someone 
    say I was 'a victim of cultural imperialism'. Quite a stressful time!</p>

<h3><a name="1994" id="1994"></a>1994</h3>
<p>'Weightless' broadcast by Radio NZ.</p>
 
  <p>Directed by Carol Dee and with Jonathon Hendry and Bronwyn Bardley in the 
    cast.</p>
<p>'Taking a Bath' made and shown in Wellington and Auckland film festivals, shown 
  'Eat Carpet' SBS Aus.</p>
 
  <p>Written by Stephen Bain and myself. Murray Lynch got some money out of the 
    QEII arts council to make this short film. Stephen and I took the main roles 
    (since we wrote them for ourselves!) and Nancy Brunning took the role of Flic, 
    the explosive girlfriend. </p>

<h3><a name="1993" id="1993"></a>1993</h3>
<p>'The Supermarket of Love'at Bats Theatre and Hamilton</p>
 
  <p>Stephen Bain, Merophie Carr and myself wrote and produced this play at Bats 
    and later took it for a ride to Hamilton (merophies hometown). </p>
