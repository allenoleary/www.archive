        versus Indirect Provision: People or Property?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In part because of 
        the need to create greater public sector efficiency in a context of industrial 
        restructuring and globalisation, and in part because of factors specific 
        to each country, the last decade or so has seen considerable debate and 
        policy changes around the issue of whether to subsidise people or property. 
        The provision of adequate and affordable housing will always require subsidy 
        for many households. The private sector simply cannot price a product 
        to provide affordability for all households. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But what is the most 
        efficient form of subsidy? Is it in the form of directly providing subsidised 
        social housing to households or is it in the form of some financial assistance 
        or supplement to enable them to shop around for their housing, for example, 
        Australia’s rent assistance. While Australia has made something of a transition 
        from direct to indirect assistance in the last two decades, the debate 
        as to where to go in the future is continuing. For more details on the 
        rationale for the two models of assistance,<font color="#FF0000"> <b>go
