      if I look, as I must, for a words definition, then I am looking at a term

    <td valign="top" align="left"><b>1</b>. The first is <b>that meaning is a 
      point in flux that is always circulating within and around the series without 
      ever belonging to the terms within it</b>; that is meaning is independent 
      of (es)sense and therefore renders the series as horizontal, a plateau rather 
      than a definition. 
      <p> <b>2</b>. <b>The Series always has an `empty space' implied at it's 
        head, a blank area that is open to re-articulation</b>, a place where 
        another term or definer can sit or a new and startling event may take 
        place. In Deleuze this event can become the domain of `nonsense', which 
        becomes not the absence of sense, but that which is outside sense and 
        yet transformative, the area for a paradigm shift. This re-articulation 
        is the beginning of his ideas that come to fruition in his later writings 
        with Guatarri, resulting in the infamous `becoming other', and `rhizomatics', 
        which we will come to in due course.

    <td valign="top" align="left"><b>The Arse-Fuck of Ideas.</b> 
      <p> <b>The very important thing about this theory of series and meaning 
        is that the apparently unitary series is always (at least) a twin</b>; 
        the terms and their definitions must present two series that oscillate 
        together. 
      <p> This implies that all concepts held in language have a relationship 
        to another concept, itself open to rearticulation and held in a horizontal 
        plane with the first; the singular is always multiple, and meaning always 
        circulates somewhere else. <b>In this sense it is possible and enlightening 
        to provide two arbitrary series of terms and see what happens</b> , how 
        one affects each other within a common `basin of attraction' or plateau; 
        a kind of conceptual Petrie dish, or, as Deleuze might say, `an arse fuck'.
