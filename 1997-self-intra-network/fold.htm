      <b>First of all - why bother with aesthetics, isn't a&nbsp;dead notion?</b>
      <p>
      Aesthetics is not popular topic, but we need to evoke it here because <b>it
      is part of the group of notions that is a thorn in the side of state
      philosophies</b>. The other members of this group are rhetoric and ethics.
      <p>
      Aesthetics, ethics and rhetoric stand in a spiky relationship to dialectic
      and&nbsp;morality because the former are contingent and local while the later
      are strategic and&nbsp;global - and constitute the inhibatory practices practiced
      by bodies of power. Aesthetics conjure the phrase `life is a work of art',
      most broadly developed by the Decadent movement.
      <p>
      While the adoption of such a&nbsp;stance may seem narcissistic, it's actually
      of vital importance and marks the will to a creative identity that escapes
      the fascist/anarchic duality.

    <td><b>Lines and Folds.</b>
      <p> <b>Every person traces a line that is enfolded</b>: The line is the 
        `will to X' which wants to go at full speed. <b>The fold is the processes 
        of life that get in the way of pure speed - the fold is the condition 
        of life</b>. 
      <p> While I would like to be able to write along a vector in one go, I need 
        to stop and attend to life, I&nbsp;need to stop and consider where the 
        line is taking me, I need to be enfolded to develop a&nbsp;critical relationship 
        with my own work. Both processes are necessary: To fold without tracing 
        a line is to stagnate (to become BUGS, to become subject to force mechanisms 
        of power states). <b>To trace a line without folding is to have a line 
        with no substance, a&nbsp;line that is useless, and in extreme cases, 
        to `lose the plot'</b>. <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top"> 
      <p>
      What does the line trace? Well that's up to&nbsp;you... It can be fractal
      in nature, splitting over several attractors into plateaus, it can challenge
      static powers or reinforce them.
      <p>
      The line I'm tracing in this essay is one that explores the phase-shift area
      between the `motor' model and the `network' model and goes on to try and
      take in some of the `virtual' model.

    <td><b>Renegade Ideas</b>
      <p> <b>The Line and the Fold are renegade notions</b>; strictly philosophical, 
        they abandon Phenomenolgy and inhabit Epistemology, they oppose the moral 
        and favour the ethical, they engage in rhetoric and try and out run the 
        dialectic. It's `living on the edge' in that it simultaneously creates 
        the edge and cuts itself on it. Hence the term `bleeding edge' for new 
        developments is a very appropriate term.

    <td><b>The Network Line</b>
      <p>
      In the context of&nbsp;this hyper-essay, the networked line becomes the net
      or web - the lines are what take us from site to site, while the fold is
      the node. <b>The commercialisation of the Network line is crystal clear in
      Microsofts tag for Windows 95; "Where do you want to go today?"</b>. The
      implication is that they will give you the means and the support to go the
      network line - and hopefully get you to follow the Virtual line.

    <td><b>The Virtual Line.</b>
      <p>
      <b>The Virtual line has no folding.</b> The embrace of pure speed makes it
      entirely unaccountable and&nbsp;a effect unto itself. The only way to fold
      a virtual line is to crash it; either it exists or it doesn't. And because
      it has no need to fold, it stands as&nbsp;an alien force to mere mortals
      who can&nbsp;only jump on for a&nbsp;short time -&nbsp;even William Gibson's
      characters don't remain jacked in forever...
      <p> <b>The Virtual Line is a new imperative; if you don't like what's happening 
        to the enfolded world then come with us, become a new version of the religious 
        ascetic, waste your body in favour of a God of pure speed, everywhere 
        at all times... and be colonised in the process.</b>
