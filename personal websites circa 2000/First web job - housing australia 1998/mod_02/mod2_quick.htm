        Dominance of Home Ownership </font></b></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Australia has been 
        a home owning society for longer than all other advanced industrial countries. 
        Australia’s level of home ownership was already almost 50% in the late 
        19th century, a figure still not achieved by most other advanced industrial 
        countries today. While a few other nations have now achieved levels similar 
        to the Australian average of 70% over the last two decades, the fact remains 
        that Australia continues to be in the forefront of countries in terms 
        of the importance of home ownership. In the last decade or so home ownership, 
        particularly for younger households has been under intense pressure and 
        the rate of ownership among new purchasers is falling.</font></p>
