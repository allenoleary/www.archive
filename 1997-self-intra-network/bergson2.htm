      <p> <font color="Black"><a name="Life"><b>Bergsons Life</b></a></font> 
      <p> Born 1859 in Paris (the year of the publication Darwins Origin of the 
        Species)into a Jewish family. Held a number of posts including a post 
        at Ecole Normale Superieure as well as receiving the Chair de Philosophie 
        at the College de France. His lectures between 1900 and 1924 were very 
        fashionable in Paris. Academies Francais in 1914 and a Nobel Prize for 
        Literature in 1928. <br>
        <br>
        Later in life he became more sympathetic to Catholicism; in his will he 
        states that the only thing stopping him being a catholic was his jewish 
        background, and a desire to sympathise with it in a time of Jewish persecution. 
        He dies in occupied Paris, after registering as a jew, which he&nbsp;could 
        have easily avoided.<br>
        <br>
        His influence was marked. Proust use of Bergson is probably the most famous 
        - the invocation of memory from a smell in `the madeline incident' is 
        heavily influenced by Bergsons idea of Duree 
      <p> <a name="Duration">B<b>ecoming: Duree and Intuition</b></a> 
      <p> Bergson reacts strongly against 19th century scientific positivism, 
        which had a dim view of `Metaphysics'. In Bergsons view Metaphysics is 
        the key, but he takes care to redefine it, taking away it's traditional 
        sense of evaluation of fixed meta truths, and making it instead as that 
        which is alive and constantly changing, and is apprehended by `intuition'.<br>
        <br>
        Intuition is the basis of Metaphysics because it grasps things from the 
        inside (absolutely)rather than as an external (relative) truth. Intuition 
        is a kind of intellectual sympathy where the subject coincides with what 
        is unique and inexpressable; the difference between a map of a city and 
        the knowledge of someone who lives there. <br>
        <br>
        This is clearly in opposition to `analysis' (the assembling of many views 
        to gain a picture of the whole) Intuition is a method is metaphysics, 
        analysis is a method of mathematics and propositional, rather than of 
        coincidence. Bergson wouldn't dismiss analytic knowledge per se, it is 
        vital in the way we get around the world, and accords with `common sense'. 
        <br>
        <br>
        However, the only thing that can be really comprehended from the inside 
        is ourselves, which is a little contradictory in a metaphysics. (See next 
        section)<br>
        Bergson goes on to examine the issue of time. In a traditional scientific 
        materialist way, time is characterised by it's strict relationship to 
        space, and a lack of direction in that events may be categorised as separate 
        and therefore theoretically reversible. However Bergson posits another 
        time experience alongside the space/time continuum, that of Duree, or 
        duration, which is the subjects sense of becoming in time instead of being 
        in it. Intensely local and unmeasurable except by impressions (there's 
        the Proust connection) this duree has a firm direction; from the past, 
        through the present and into the future. Also duree has no sharp boundaries 
        between past present and future, there is always a flow effect, a blurring 
        of any arbitrary drawing of boundaries. In this sense duree is our inner 
        experience, unique and unsharable.<br>
        <br>
        Duree is identified as occurring at only the deepest and most personal 
        level of the self, overlaid with a plethora of events where we are acting 
        as being with attributes, common sense and so forth. The closer we get 
        to this inner level, the less it will be able to be expressed in public 
        language. 
      <h3> <a name="freeWill">Free Will</a> </h3>
      <p> This unique take on the individuality of an individuals experience, 
        enabled Bergson to avoid the traditional problems of free will (one, that 
        every thing is determined, two that everything is random) and at the deepest 
        individual level emotions, thoughts etc flow into each other in such a 
        way that to draw a cause and effect is pointless. In this way, even though 
        I can say that, yes, the madeline holds associative memories, only Proust 
        can have Prousts Duree experience. In the same way, difficult moral or 
        emotional questions can not be solved by resorting to reason alone, or 
        to a systematic psychology; there comes a point where everyone has to 
        make decisions completely for and by oneself. Likewise, the libertarian 
        view is subject to it's own contradictory logic; if to be free is to be 
        uncaused, then you could never make a choice because making a choice is 
        to have a cause for your actions (even in Duree). 
      <p> <a name="Metaphysics"><!-- --><b>Intuition and Metaphysics</b></a> 
      <p> There is quite a leap in Bergson from intuition as a term for the way 
        we experience ourselves from the inside and a way of outlining a metaphysics: 
        to be me is different from grasping the truth of what being me is. Bergson 
        was aware of this leap, and his first conceptions of time were not generated 
        by dwelling on how we are in the world, but by examining the more traditional 
        problem of Zenos' Paradoxes and their classically metaphysical construct. 
        To look into the whole thing more, Bergson started to draw on the worlds 
        of biological life and evolution, which he saw as intuitive things, and 
        look at becoming in this wider context; the connections between the life 
        of the mind and the life of the body in a developing socius. 
      <h3> <a name="Body"></a>Body. </h3>
      <p> Also Bergson sets up a new attitude to the body, somewhat more sympathetic 
        to Descartes Mind/Body split and Dualisitc approaches to the body in general. 
        Bergson affirms both the reality of the spirit and the reality of the 
        body. But rather than separating them he does a `gradient fill' on them, 
        that is they shade into each other. It's impossible to treat our bodies 
        as just another object, it is the way I interact with things around me, 
        an inseparable part of our way of becoming in the world. Any attempt to 
        apprehend the world is conditioned by our body, our sense of duree, which 
        has a large component of bodily resonance. With these kinds of ideas, 
        Bergson laid a way for a long line of French Philosophy (in particular 
        but not exclusively) that deals with embodiment. 
      <h3> <a name="elanVital"></a>Elan Vital...<br>
      </h3>
      <p> Bergson published Creative Evolution in 1907. In it he tied together 
        the ideas of duree with general concepts of the evolution of life. Understood 
        from a contemporary basis of chaos theory, and the idea of an infinite 
        zoom - where mass effects can be observed from the behaviour of cells 
        through to the behaviour of galaxies - this makes good sense. 
      <p> Dissatisfied by Darwinian emphasis on a sort of mathematical determinacy, 
        Bergson developed ideas that related to complexity - why should a life 
        form actually be bothered to evolve into a complex life form when it could 
        survive just as well as a simple one? He characterised evolution as emergent 
        and creative. hE believed that there was no plan to evolution, and that 
        change could only be explained retrospectively and not predicted. This 
        idea lives on through the `punctuated equilibria' theory of development, 
        which itself ties in nicely with the bifurcation thing, where a system 
        goes from regular to chaotic to regular motion again unaided and unpredictably. 
        There is also nice correlation in all this to body-memory.<br>
