<font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2"><b>Aarseth: Typology 
of Cybertext </b></font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2">From: &quot;Cybertext: 
  Perspectives on Ergodic Literature&quot; (1997, John Hopkins University Press)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2"><b>Abstract</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2">Aarseth argues that 
  literature is a kind of game where the work and the reader (or user) work together 
  to create meaning. In traditional literature this game takes place in the mind 
  and imagination of the user and involves sophisticated play with genre, language 
  and narrative form. In hypermedia or Multimedia (what he calls Ergodic) the 
  user constructs the work by physically choosing various paths through the possible 
  paths or options presented; so writing for Multimedia concerns both the planning 
  and making of the physical aspect of the work (the interface and visual/aural 
  elements), the plotting of the work through multiple pathways (programming if 
  you like), and the writing of any text and imagery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2">He makes some of the 
  following points:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2"> The text that 
    the reader gets may only be a small subsection of all the text available to 
    the reader, and that the received text may change on each use.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2"> Literary Machines 
    can be games, MUDs, hypertext fiction, story generators, story agents, etc. 
    They may not be realised on the computer (he uses the example of the I Ching 
    as a work that is a literary machine independent of the computer).</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2"><b>The Typology</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2">He then works out 
  a typology (a theoretical model) to describe cybertexts. he uses the following 
  ideas and terms:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2">Dynamics: The work 
    is static if the text of the work is always the same, dynamic if it shifts 
    over various readings. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2">Determinability: 
    If the work always yields the same responses to user input, the work is determinable. 
    If a choice can result in a variety of outcomes, then the work is indeterminate.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2"> Transiency: If 
    the script carries on at its own pace without user input, the work is transient. 
    If it requires user input to move forward, the work is intransient.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2"> Perspective: If 
    the text requires the user to play a role then the perspective is personal, 
    if not it is impersonal.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2"> Access: If any 
    part of the work can be accessed at any time the work is random access, if 
    not then the access is controlled.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2"> Linking: If links 
    are always I the same place, the linking is explicit. If links are only available 
    after certain actions have been performed, they are conditional. There can 
    also be no links at all.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif, Tahoma" size="2"> User Function: 
    There are several ways the user can interact with the work: Explorative, where 
    the user must decide on a path to take. Configurative, where the user chooses 
    the order or writes sections. Interpretive, where the users only option is 
    to read and not interact with the piece. Textonic, where the user can permanently 
    add to the work.</font></li>
