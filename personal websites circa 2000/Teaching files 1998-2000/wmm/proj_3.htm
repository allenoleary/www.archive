<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Final Assessment 
  Piece, </b></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'Writing For 
  Multimedia' Date Due: Worth: 40% </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Select one of the 
  following themes (or choose your own in consultation with your tutor) as a focus 
  for creating a prototype of an interactive multimedia narrative. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) Theme Parks 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) Subcultures 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) Family Histories 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4) Travels</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This piece may 
  be either fictional or non-fictional, documentary, artistic, experimental, training, 
  or informative. It must be interactive and can be designed as either a web, 
  or fixed media, presentation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Students are expected 
  to produce a written document that conveys a concise impression of the narrative, 
  aesthetic and interactive designs features that would make up the work, while 
  rendering, or realising, some key aspects of the projected work. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The document must 
  consist of: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) Title and a 
  one-line synopsis </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) A one paragraph 
  synopsis </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) Illustration 
  of the Interactive Pathways that present the narrative to the user, with a clear 
  articulation of the ways in which narrative and story elements are linked to 
  each other </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4) Interface Design, 
  including a mock-up of a navigational screen that shows how users will engage 
  the content of the work. When and where decisions are made by the user, how 
  much control they have over the way the narrative is revealed. You can have 
  more than one navigational screen and the navigation may be less anchored or 
  menu-like than a navigational screen suggests. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5) Character sketches 
  where applicable, or a brief background of the key people or key issues to be 
  tackled by the project </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6) Brief description 
  of the major storylines </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7) Description 
  of the narrative world. Its rules, belief sytems, heirarchies, appearance, politics, 
  spokespeople etc. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You might also 
  consider the relationship between any narrators you might use and their narrative 
  world. They could be newcomers, critics, journalists, prisoners, people with 
  a mental illness etc. Think about the possibility of inventing a character or 
  narrator to tell your story. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8) Rationale. What 
  does your project aim to achieve? In what ways does multimedia provide particular 
  challenges and/or particular advantages in the realisation of this narrative 
  and narrative world? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9) Students are 
  expected to render an aspect of their project that conveys some of the metaphorical, 
  thematic and narrative content of the larger work. This can be linear or interactive. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note: Students 
  are expected to illustrate aspects of their project to convey some of the metaphorical, 
  thematic and narrative content of the larger work. These illustrations can be 
  digital or physical. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Assessment</b></font></p>
