      <P><B>The Wheel Has Already Been Invented</B></P>
      <P>Digital narrative offers us new opportunities for how we tell stories 
      and how we can experience stories. Interactive Fiction itself has been 
      around for twenty years. Crowther and Wood's <I>Colossal Caves</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#caves"><SUP>1</SUP></A> 
      gained wide-spread notoriety in 1977 when it was being passed around for 
      use on mainframe computers at universities<A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#coa"><SUP>2</SUP></A>. 
      It is now also known as <I>Original Adventure</I>. One of the most 
      sensible sites on digital narrative that I have encountered which speaks 
      from those twenty years of experience is the <I>Interactive Fiction</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#if"><SUP>3</SUP></A> 
      site. The writers featured on this site roll up their sleeves and get to 
      the nitty gritty of plotting, character development, and known pitfalls to 
      avoid. These are not professional experts, just fans who have been at it 
      for a long time. Ten years after the appearance of interactive fiction 
      HyperCard, a popular hypertext system, was first released free of charge 
      to all Apple Macintosh system owners. <I>Myst</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#myst"><SUP>4</SUP></A> 
      was originally designed on Hypercard. Storyspace, another hypertextual 
      system dedicated to storytelling, was released by Eastcom in 1990 and in 
      1992 WWW was released by CERN. All of these have offered ever widening 
      spheres of how stories can be told.</P>
      <P><B>Make Friends with a Propeller-Head Today</B></P>
      <P>Probably the biggest stumbling block to storytellers making sensible 
      use of the medium is their lack of experience with it. No creators should 
      apply for grants or try putting together investments until they have 
      formed a solid relationship with an experienced programmer. Someone with 
      programming experience can quickly look over your plans and see right away 
      where you are asking for the unworkable, the limited and the old hat. I 
      would say this is a vital first step along with spending time actually 
      playing computer games, reading hypertext fiction and exploring various 
      CD-ROM titles.</P>
      <P>The <I>Interactive Writer's Handbook</I> contains a proposal for a game 
      called <I>Magic Drum</I>. This document is merely meant to demonstrate the 
      form of a proposal, but it also demonstrates where non-technical game 
      writers can go wrong:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>SUMMARY 
        <P>As a powerful shaman, you must explore the surrealistic Realms of the 
        Spirits, to deliver your apprentice to the World Tree. Using your 
        control over the elements and animals, as well as the power of your 
        Magic Drum, you must protect your pupil from Baltar, the fearsome shaman 
        who will attempt to keep you from reaching the World Tree.</P>
        <P>(Samsel &amp; Wimberley p. 51)<A 
        href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#s&amp;w"><SUP>5</SUP></A> 
        </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>A number of problems become obvious with this proposal. First of all, 
      you are required to play a shaman, but you have a choice over which of 
      five possible apprentices will assist you. As simply a player I find the 
      thought of choosing my own character more intriguing. As a woman I am 
      appalled that I am required to play a male character when with the 
      apprentices I can choose either gender. So why not make them the focus of 
      the game? Next a complex interface is needed so that a bewildering variety 
      of variables can be applied to the situations you face. These variables 
      include: the four forces of water, fire, earth and wind; the Magic Drum 
      containing the celestial map, entry to the Realm of Spirits and the World 
      Tree; a bag of tricks containing a medicine pouch, weapons, tools, and 
      gifts; animal spirits that endow you with transformational powers; and the 
      powers of prayer. First of all imagine all the programming necessary to 
      create the characters of the shaman, Baltar and the five apprentices; then 
      imagine all the programming necessary to make all those different 
      variables effective in a variety of episodes; now imagine writing a 
      sensible storyline that brings together all of these elements providing a 
      unique experience every time you play given your choice of characters and 
      actions. To make each of those choices meaningful turns this game into an 
      enormous endeavour.</P>
      <P><B>General Field of Choice, Captain Involvement</B></P>
      <P>Many digital narrative theorists speak about how the digital medium 
      frees us from authorial control, as if the artist is some sort of dictator 
      rather than someone who shapes and shares experiences. From this 
      perspective it can be difficult to look beyond formless meta-narrative as 
      a legitimate way to tell a story. Many other reasons are available for why 
      an artist might wish to simply share creative control which could include 
      the sense of involvement it generates, an expanded sensual experience and 
      new ways of thinking about ourselves and the shapes of our lives in this 
      century. Keeping this in mind helps creators offer more intelligent 
      choices, not merely choice for choice's sake. I am already free to enter 
      or not enter the creation of another artist, once I have made that 
      agreement I want a fulfilling experience whether it is emotional or 
      intellectual.</P>
      <P>As a first step in creating a digital narrative creators need to decide 
      whether they are dealing with a closed or open narrative since these will 
      determine the general range of choices you will be able to offer your 
      audience.</P>
      <P><B><I>* Closed Narrative - Open Exploration</I></B></P>
      <P><I>The storyline is set, but the audience is free to move around the 
      narrative environment in different ways.</I></P>
      <P>Within this structure the audience is not going to be able to affect 
      the flow or outcome of a story, but in so doing this gives them the 
      freedom to explore the story in more detail and/or in any order. <I>Just 
      Grandma and Me</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#granny"><SUP>6</SUP></A> 
      is a superb example. Within this CD-ROM we are presented with a 
      straightforward little tale about a boy and his grandmother going to the 
      beach and having a fun day together. In no way are we going to be 
      influencing the tale, it simply flows from page to page just as if it were 
      a book. However, within each book page, a million tiny adventures are 
      available to enrich the story with the click of a mouse . "Click!" and the 
      frog goes water-skiing across the page. "Click!" and the starfish does a 
      little dance. "Click!" and the radio starts to play the <I>Just Grandma 
      and Me</I> theme tune. Then stories such as <I>24 Hours with Someone You 
      Know</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#24hour"><SUP>7</SUP></A> 
      allow you to travel through the narrative in a number of different ways. 
      Such narratives are like being free to look at a diamond's facets in any 
      way the reflected and refracted light catches your eye, and yet in the end 
      you still have a complete satisfying story.</P>
      <P><B><I>* Open Narrative - Closed Options</I></B></P>
      <P><I>The storyline may have diverse outcomes or entirely participant 
      driven narrative, however within the constraints of what is appropriate to 
      the particular narrative environment.</I></P>
      <P>Despite a lot of idealism about how much more realistic digital 
      narrative can be because of the mass of branching storylines available, 
      creators simply cannot offer all possible choices to their audience. 
      However, this is taken care of by developing a world whereby certain 
      choices are more likely and more appropriate to the environment. Within 
      <I>FurryMUCK</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#furry"><SUP>8</SUP></A>, 
      an online roleplaying world, all characters are expected to be 
      anthropomorphic like Bugs Bunny or Mickey Mouse. You would not get very 
      far or be allowed to build onto this world if you came in as the 
      Terminator. In a section of the CD-ROM game <I>Discworld</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#disc"><SUP>9</SUP></A> 
      if you ask your avatar to go into one part of town early in the game, he 
      cries out that you are crazy to lead him into such a dangerous place and 
      won't go until he is better prepared.</P>
      <P><B>Particular Realms of Audience Influence</B></P>
      <P>For the inexperienced creator of digital media it is easy to rely upon 
      a few realms of choice within an open or closed environment. Nothing is 
      wrong with this except when because of a lack of familiarity, it becomes 
      obvious that the audience is not being offered sensible realms of choice 
      for the material given. As in any other artform artists must have a firm 
      grasp of their tools. I have identified eight realms of audience influence 
      that digital creators have to consider each time they develop a new 
      title.</P>
      <P><B><I>* Select different focal characters or perspectives.</I></B></P>
      <P>The developers of <I>Magic Drum</I> obviously had a grasp of this 
      choice in the selection of apprentices. Many arcade games such as 
      <I>Virtua Fighter</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#virt"><SUP>10</SUP></A> 
      and <I>The Simpsons</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#simp"><SUP>11</SUP></A> 
      will let you select the character you wish to play since each character 
      represents different qualities and has different abilities for negotiating 
      the challenges you face. This works best for works that are more game than 
      story if the title is highly graphical, just for the sheer volume of work 
      involved in making the characters individual. Character investigations of 
      more depth, for the time being, still work best with non-linear written 
      narrative. Differing perspective, nevertheless, can indicate not only 
      different character viewpoints, but whether you are participating in a 
      scene from a first or third person perspective. This is more broadly 
      do-able. <I>The Ancient Art of War</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#aofw"><SUP>12</SUP></A>, 
      a simulation game based on the work by Sun Tzu, allows you to arrange your 
      armies for battle from a map like overview and then observe the outcome, 
      or you can zoom in on any individual skirmish and direct individual 
      soldiers in their fights.</P>
      <P><B><I>* Modify character.</I></B></P>
      <P>This is often fairly superficial as you are given the ability to change 
      the clothing and maybe the hair colour of your character, but it does give 
      you a greater sense of involvement since you have customised the character 
      to be more expressive of some qualities you wish to play with in this 
      world and therefore you have a greater sense of attachment to this 
      character. <I>The Palace</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#palace"><SUP>13</SUP></A>, 
      an online chat environment, gives you a set of props that you can decorate 
      your smiley face with so that you can develop a recognisable presence. By 
      sending in your money and registering with <I>The Palace</I> you can also 
      use images you have created yourself. Doom makes it possible for you to 
      change the images of the villains as well. More significant modifications 
      sometimes made available are skills and physical abilities. This is common 
      amongst the <I>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</I> (TM) style roleplaying games 
      whether on CD-ROM such as <I>Heroes of Might and Magic</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#homm"><SUP>14</SUP></A> 
      or an adventure MUD on the Internet like <I>DragonMUD</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#drag"><SUP>15</SUP></A>.</P>
      <P><B><I>* Modify environment.</I></B></P>
      <P>Again this is usually superficial, but it can nonetheless create a 
      shift in emotional and intellectual context as well as generating more 
      involvement. <I>Extreme Pinball</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#epin"><SUP>16</SUP></A> 
      allows you to select which pinball environment you wish to toss a ball 
      around in. You can play within "Monkey Mayhem" where you are in a zoo 
      environment and friendly hamsters help you gain points or "Urban Chaos" 
      where you face down criminals and gain points by restoring law and order 
      to the city. The basics are pretty much the same for both games, yet the 
      implied stories make quite a difference in how you experience what you are 
      doing, whether you laugh or feel serious intensity. I would include in 
      environmental influence the ability to change the background music, since 
      that too affects how you feel about the events going on. <I>OutRun</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#out"><SUP>17</SUP></A> 
      made clever use of this by giving you the choice of tunes your car radio 
      will play as you go racing down different race tracks.</P>
      <P><B><I>* Select metaphor.</I></B></P>
      <P>This is more of an interface choice than directly a storytelling one. 
      Yet, it too can enhance the tone and overall character of how you 
      experience a title. In allowing the audience to select their own metaphor, 
      they can choose that metaphor which is most meaningful to them and 
      therefore easier to navigate with. Easy navigation means the story 
      experience has a greater opportunity to be a seamless one with a real 
      sense of flow, whereby the audience is unaware of the fact that they are 
      sitting in front of a computer. I haven't really seen this used within a 
      narrative environment, but I have experienced it with <I>Power 
      Chords</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#power"><SUP>18</SUP></A>, 
      music composition software. With <I>Power Chords</I> you can compose a 
      piece of music using a score, guitar frets or drum notation which ever 
      makes the most sense to you. It also creates it's own implicit story 
      whereby you imagine yourself playing different sorts of instruments in 
      order to generate greater ease in creating.</P>
      <P><B><I>* Select different pathways.</I></B></P>
      <P>Both closed and open narratives can offer you the opportunity to wander 
      freely through the narrative environment. Within a closed environment this 
      offers you an opportunity to find out more about the plot or a character, 
      like peeling the layers of an onion, so that eventually you come to a 
      deeper understanding of people and events. <I>Myst</I> is this sort of 
      story. In your quest to find more pages to release the trapped brothers, 
      you learn why they are trapped in living books and what sort of scoundrels 
      you are dealing with. Within an open environment free movement gives you 
      the opportunity to acclimatise yourself to the nature and expectations of 
      the world you have just entered so as to make more effective choices when 
      enjoying the game. <I>Furtoonia</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#toon"><SUP>19</SUP></A>, 
      a MUD, actively encourages players to explore this world by rewarding them 
      with pennies every so many areas they visit. These pennies can be used by 
      the players to build new areas to the world.</P>
      <P><B><I>* Explore different consequences or outcomes.</I></B></P>
      <P>The exploration of differing consequences I find the most exciting 
      narrative addition that digital storytelling has to offer and the greatest 
      challenge to creators. Creators need to select thematic investigations 
      that include the possibility of multiple outcomes and present real chioces 
      with real outcomes. Nothing annoys the audience more than to be presented 
      with two apparently good choices only to find that one, for no real 
      reason, leads to certain death. It's a cop-out, a short-cut made for 
      convenience's sake and serves neither the story nor the audience. A 
      skilled digital creator will create situations where you are primarily 
      interested in the choices that you are given, and not suggest unavailable 
      ones. A skilled digital creator will create outcomes that are fair to who 
      the character is and the events that have lead to that outcome. I am 
      fascinated by the idea of stories where choices lead to different but 
      possibly equally appealing outcomes, so that we pull away from the idea 
      that there is only one right way to travel through life. <I>The Forever 
      Growing Garden</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#garden"><SUP>20</SUP></A> 
      has some of this feeling about it, in that you can select any collection 
      of seeds you like and regardless of which seeds you choose, it is still 
      fun watching them grow and finally get harvested. </P>
      <P><B><I>* Expand your knowledge or experience of a scene.</I></B></P>
      <P>This is the particular field of choice most often used by closed 
      narratives and yet it is available to open narrative as well. Any title 
      that involves a mystery where you have to search for clues, a treasure or 
      scavenger hunt where you are searching for pieces to achieve the prize or 
      an educational work, will give you the ability to observe and learn about 
      various people and objects in a scene. <I>Under a Killing Moon</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#uakm"><SUP>21</SUP></A> 
      requires fairly close investigation of each environment you enter 
      including looking under desks, inside a grating, beneath a door mat, etc. 
      so you can solve who committed a theft at the local pawn shop, recover an 
      artifact and stop a plot to commit genocide. <I>EcoQuest: The Search for 
      Cetus</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#eco"><SUP>22</SUP></A> 
      not only expects you to find clues and solve puzzles which help you learn 
      about the importance of the ocean environment, but some items you click on 
      will provide text about how you can help in keeping the planet clean.</P>
      <P><B><I>* Select presentation format (e.g. text, audio, 
      video).</I></B></P>
      <P>Different people respond to different presentation formats with greater 
      or lesser comprehension. Some people absorb information best when they 
      receive it aurally, others when they receive it visually and still others 
      when they are kinetically involved. Receiving information in a variety of 
      ways means that information gets broad sensual reinforcement in our memory 
      and provides a whole experience. Games such as the <I>Carmen 
      Sandiego</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#carmen"><SUP>23</SUP></A> 
      series uses a variety of presentation formats from printed text to 
      animated sequences. For artistic reasons <I>The Complete Maus</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#maus"><SUP>24</SUP></A> 
      gives the audience a choice of presentation formats in order to enrich 
      their experience of the story of survivors of the Holocaust. On the 
      Internet it is vital that graphic works are available in a text format as 
      well, since many students and people from a number of countries can only 
      receive text on their connection.</P>
      <P>Creators just entering the field of digital media are tending to work 
      under a false synecdoche whereby they are mistaking the filmic part of 
      digital narrative for the whole of the medium. <I>You Don't Know 
      Jack</I><A 
      href="http://www.glasswings.com.au/modern/choice.htm#jack"><SUP>25</SUP></A> 
      relies primarily on the aural with minimal graphics and no video, and has 
      been a great commercial success. A creator can emphasize the book-like, 
      the musical, the filmic or any other possible similarities with other 
      media in the telling of the story and do well to keep all such 
      possibilites available as a part of their bag of magic tricks.</P>
      <P><B>Grand Finale</B></P>
      <P>I find the field of digital creation an exciting one precisely because 
      so much more is waiting to be done. I think everyone is still a little 
      clumsy in the use of their materials as people are having to get 
      comfortable with making new alliances between the technological and the 
      artistic, doing away with old prejudices that the two are mutally 
      exclusive. This new alliance is adding more warmth to computing, helping 
      to further the cause of drawing people into using it as a way to connect 
      with other people and themselves, rather than feeling alienated by its 
      presence. I have consistently found that when people enjoy using their 
      computers through stories and games, they feel empowered to use computers 
      in other ways that free them to create and communicate in their own right. 
      A work does not have to be educational or experimental to be significant 
      in this medium, being fun is also important. As a creator give people more 
      choices for quality enrichment and quality enjoyment. </P>
