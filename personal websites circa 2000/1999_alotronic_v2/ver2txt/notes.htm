<h1>alotronic: notes</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This version of my alotronic site is a transitional affair: Soon I will be 
  getting a domain of my own and moving onto an NT4 box so that I can play with 
  ASP and ColdFusion. I do maintain ares of this site using a basic Cold Fusion 
  content mangement site I developed for my desktop where the actual html pages 
  are generated by Cold Fusion templatesa. </p>
<p>As this current site sits on an apache server, there's not much I can do as 
  my skills don't extend to arcane unix scripting languages, the best I can do 
  is stutter... However there are some other points of interest:</p>
	<h2>Text-only version</h2>
<p>This area of the alotronic website has been specifically designed for maximum 
  user access. In the work I have done in the web publishing corporate sector, 
  this is not usually a priority. However, the W3C has laid out clear guidelines 
  fo ensuring maximum access and a system of ranking websites for access issues. 
  this system is entirely voluntary. </p>
<p>In general, those designing sites for maximum access should consider the following 
  points: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Users may not have the latest hardware or software.</li>
  <li>Users may have a slow internet connection, or pay a premium for access.</li>
  <li>Users may have a visual or other disablity.</li>
</ol>
<p>The W3C has many solutions for the above problems which fall in several areas:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Provide text alternatives for any images (including animations) through 
    'alt' tags, 'longdesc' tags and 'title' tags.</li>
  <li>Provide layout and style information through style-sheets and not 'font' 
    tags.</li>
  <li>Provide alternative navigation for users using 'tabindex' or 'accesskey' 
    attributes, and give more information about link targets</li>
</ol>
<p>I have incorporated all these features into this area of this site.</p>
<h2>Xhtml</h2>
<p>This site is also ready for the future, all pages are XHTML compliant. XHTML 
  is the inbetween markup between HTML and XML. It has no DTD like XML, but can 
  at least be read by an XML parser without going bellyup.</p>
