      <b>Chaos, first steps.</b> 
      <p> <b>Chaos theory is the generic name for the study of complex systems 
        and how they work.</b> Catastrophe theory is an earlier name for the same 
        thing. 
      <p> <b>A simple system,</b> like a light switch, has two attractors, one 
        of which is called `on' and the other `off'. There is a shift in the state 
        of the system across a break point that takes it from one state to another, 
        and we can generally rely on that system remaining stable and functional.

    <td align="left" valign="top"><b>Chaotic behaviour.</b> 
      <p> <b>Yet a small shift in the system can render it chaotic;</b> if we 
        take a pendulum which has at one end `left' and the other `right' and 
        set the pendulum going under regular motion we quickly find that, while 
        sometimes it oscillates neatly between left and right, at other times 
        it takes new paths. <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes 
        the path is elliptical, sometimes it is a figure of eight. Any attempt 
        to actually predict the path that the pendulum will describe is completely 
        arbitrary in that the behaviour of the pendulum, while determinate, is 
        not predictable and any influence, no matter how subtle, could change 
        the path; it has entered the realm of the chaotic. 
      <p><b>Strange Attractors.</b> 
      <p> When a system becomes chaotic, the left and right nodes in our example 
        are said to become `strange attractors', and <b>the path of the pendulum 
        comes and goes through the `basins of attraction', making `phase-shifts' 
        as it passes from one basin to another.</b> Each time the pendulum swings 
        it begins an entirely new relationship with the strange attractors, taking 
        its qualities of speed and direction into a fresh relationship with them.

    <td bgcolor="#f5e7c2" valign="middle" width="150"><font size="-1">One of the 
      most surprising things about chaos is that <b>systems are often `chaotic' 
      even when they appear to be stable; </b>the best example is water. A still 
      lake is more chaotic than a river; in turbulence the level of predictability 
      is higher than in systems that have yet to organise themselves in a flow.</font></td>

      <p><b>Beyond the pendulum..</b>. </p>
      <p> <b>If the motion of a simple pendulum is impossible to predict, how 
        about when the system we are examining is a weather pattern, the flow 
        of water, or a political movement? </b>The furthest we can go is say that 
        that the system will develop sets of tendencies and these are largely 
        based on our understanding of the mathematics of complexity, or number 
        systems that exhibit chaotic tendencies, such as the mandelbrot set. 
      <p><b>From Maths to Poststructuralism</b> </p>
      <p> While the Mandelbrot set <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;and 
        similar mathematical sets are able to show the path of chaotic systems, 
        these systems also exist in other forms. The work of Deleuze, for instance, 
        contains a similar set of functional abstractions: Talking very loosely 
        the <b>strange attractors are abstract machines, the paths taken by something 
        in a basin of attraction are rhyzomes and the areas of phase-shift are 
        plateaus or planes of consistency</b>. Stable and Chaotic systems are 
        characterised as molar or molecular, the first being efforts of a system 
        to act in a `zero' state of fascism and the second are systems which are 
        `becoming' something else. 
      <p><b>This rough mapping allows us to examine concepts and ideas in a similar 
        way to physical systems,</b> though it should always be remembered that, 
        like a physical experiment, &nbsp;it's not always possible to fix both 
        the `speed' and `position' at the same time. And following this, <b>the 
        position of the subject within a network affects both the network and 
        the subject,</b> changing it's path in relationship to many things, moral, 
        intellectual, actual and virtual, and vitally effects what we think `meaning' 
        is...

      Mandelbrot set is our current image of chaos.</font></b><font size="-1"> 
      It is an iterative formula that is computed with initial values. The change 
      in these values create phase-shifts that are pictured on the computer screen 
      in the familiar pattern; in the mandelbrot set the absolute values of 1 
      and 0 are attractors that the set of numbers generated tend to move towards, 
      without ever reaching these values. <b>Because each instance of the mandelbrot 
      equation is a potentially infinite set, the computer image we see is a map 
      of part of that set</b>. The `zoom in' effect is a recalculation of the 
      numbers within the area that we choose to re-examine.</font></td>
