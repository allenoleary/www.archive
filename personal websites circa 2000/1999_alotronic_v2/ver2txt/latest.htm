<h1>alotronic: latest news</h1>

<h3 tabindex="1">March 2000: Allen wins Swinburne Uni Postgraduate Award</h3>

  <p>Yes, someone thought <a href="../../casino/index.htm" target="_blank">the 
    casino project</a> was the best thing that happened in postgrad coursework 
    at Swinburne in 1998. And they gave me some money too, which was nice!</p>
  
<p>Much respect to Lisa and Fran for getting me interested and providing encouragement 
  along the way...</p>
<h3 tabindex="2">February 2000: My stage play 'Deviations' to be developed by Elbow Theatre 
</h3>
<p>Elbow Theatre recently applied for some development money to spend a couple 
  of weeks going through 'Deviations' with me, and were successful. Sometime later 
  in the year I will go up to Canberra and spend two weeks with them on the script. 
  At the conclusion of the workshop period there will be a staged reading (a requiremnt 
  of the grant) and hopefully they will feel inspired enough to mount a production. 
</p>
<p>Elbow Theatre was started by Ian Sinclair and Ken Spiteri in 1998, and has 
  done productions in Melbourne, Canberra and a Seson at B Sharp in Sydney. Ian 
  has also worked in the UK, and tutors at Aust National University as well as 
  directing. Ken is a friend of my good friend Stephen Bain - they met in Paris 
  doing a course with Enrique Pardau...</p>
<h3 tabindex="3">January 2000: Allen escapes corporate world to teach and write </h3>
<p>After a satisfying and productive six months with SAI, I've moved back from 
  the brink of corporate respectability. Now I'm teaching again (sessional al 
  VUT tafe and Swinburne Uni) in Electronic Design and Interactive Media - which 
  just means web publishing. </p>
<p>My goal is now to complete a few drafts of some plays I have hanging around 
  and do some of my own web projects and freelance work.</p>
