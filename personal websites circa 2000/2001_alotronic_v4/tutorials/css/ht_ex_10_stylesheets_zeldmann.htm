      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Why Understanding 
        the Difference is what it's all about</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My father 
        was a Sunday painter, and his art books played a formative role in my 
        childhood. Like many kids, I was fascinated by sheer representation. I 
        lost myself gazing at painstakingly rendered engravings of battling gladiators, 
        picturesque villages, and Roman ruins at sunrise. I understood art to 
        be synonymous with "drawing well." The more painstaking the detail, the 
        more lines in the etching or leaves on the tree, the better the artist 
        in my childish, unformed estimation. Later, I discovered comic books. 
        Still later, museums. Maxfield Parrish made me want to take drugs, and 
        also made me realize I could never be a painter. Paul Klee seemed like 
        a "bad artist" who "couldn't draw." Andy Warhol was a "cheater" because 
        he used assistants.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I do not 
        pretend to understand art today, but I do know that my earliest impressions 
        had little to do with the nature of art, and everything to do with pure 
        visual sensation. Like Disneyland and the circus, art was spectacle. But 
        you can only ride the Matterhorn so many times, and you can only chomp 
        so much cotton candy, before nausea sets in. From sensation, I graduated 
        to style. Steve Ditko's Spider-Man. Pop art. Rock, and then soul, and 
        then punk album covers. I was a Style addict. I could not tell good from 
        bad, but I knew what was cool. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many young 
        Web designers — and let's face it, most Web designers are under 30 — view 
        their craft the way I used to view pop culture. It's cool or it's crap. 
        They mistake Style for Design, when the two things are not the same at 
        all. Design communicates on every level. It tells you where you are, cues 
        you to what you can do, and facilitates the doing. Style is tautological; 
        it communicates stylishness. In visual terms, style is an aspect of design; 
        in commercial terms, style can communicate brand attributes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It can also 
        convey the designer's contempt for the subject matter. "This is boring, 
        so here are some stripes and here's a drop-down menu, so you'll know I'm 
        better than this stupid assignment." On this level, style is an underground 
        language, from one peer to another, having nothing to do with the site's 
        visitors or purpose. Indeed, this stylistic appliqué can interfere with 
        the site's purpose. Then the usability gurus step in, blaming Design for 
        the failings of stylistic fetishism.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Designers 
        driven by Style can succeed if they are lucky enough to pick and choose 
        projects that benefit from their stylistic obsessions. Most Web designers 
        do not have that luxury. But that doesn't stop them from applying the 
        stylistic vocabulary of leading designers to the projects they do have 
        to work on. And so we end up with e-commerce sites that resemble rave 
        flyers, and informational sites embellished with occasionally dazzling 
        but more frequently misguided and inappropriate intros. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Web used 
        to look like a phone book. Now much of it looks like a design portfolio. 
        In fact, it looks like the design portfolio of 20 well-known designers, 
        whose style gets copied again and again by young designers who consider 
        themselves disciples. Distinctions between graphic design and communications 
        design are lost on these designers. As is the distinction between true 
        style, which evolves from the nature of the project, and derivative pastiche, 
        which is grafted onto many projects like a third arm. When Style is a 
        fetish, sites confuse visitors, hurting users and the companies that paid 
        for the sites. When designers don't start by asking who will use the site, 
        and what they will use it for, we get meaningless eye candy that gives 
        beauty a bad name — at least, in some circles. </font></p>
