        2. Home Ownership in Australia</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>4&#9;Migration</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Australia is a country 
        of migrants. The indigenous Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have 
        been swamped by successive generations of migrants, mainly from poor working-class 
        backgrounds. Most came from large industrial cities where they lived in 
        rental housing which gave them little security. Upon arrival in Australia, 
        a housing sector that promised some control over their own destiny must 
        have had immense allure. It is important in this context to note that, 
        within one or two generations, most ethnic groups achieve ownership rates 
        higher than the longer established population.</font> </p>
