        <br>
        By HELEN THOPMSON THEATRE REVIEW<br>
        <br>
        Deviations, described as a stylish black comedy about sex, is by Canberra's 
        Elbow Theatre Company. The play's description is accurate enough, in fact 
        it could also be called "relationships in the new millennium". The deviations 
        are sexual, but they also refer to those little swerves from the truth 
        that sneak into relationships sometimes. In fact, the stories told by 
        Matt to his live-in partner Karen, to chicks at the pub, and to the lonely 
        stranger Richard, are more properly described as whoppers, and they ultimately 
        lead to tragedy.<br>
        <br>
        Richard and Susan are also living together, former lovers, now both gay, 
        for whom true love is hard to find. Matt and Karen are struggling with 
        her aversion to sex in the aftermath of a rape. Like random molecules 
        they inevitably bump into one another as they trawl Melbourne's singles 
        scene, and suddenly the boundaries between sexual preferences seems rather 
        blurred. Karen finds lesbian sex enjoyable; Richard sees a solution to 
        his problems in Matt and his story of having only six months to live. 
        <br>
        <br>
        But things go horribly wrong, and the play takes us from lively comedy 
        to tragedy, leaving many questions in the air. Some of them are libertarian 
        ones about just where personal freedom and individualism are taking us. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Allen O'Leary's writing is lively, his dialogues snappy and funny, and 
        there is just enough of a sub-text, though barely articulated, to lift 
        this play out of the quicksands of a sitcom where "deviations" are presented 
        merely for their shock and/or entertainment value. This scene is cool 
        enough not to be shadowed by too many expectations of "normality", but 
        it is a pity the norm from which these characters deviate is not more 
        searchingly interrogated. The last quarter of the play's two hours gets 
        bogged down in plot resolution and some repetition. The short, snappy 
        early scenes eventually reveal their downside: a failure to define and 
        get to grips with the central issues.<br>
        <br>
        However, the cast, Pip Branson as Matt, Michael Butcher as Richard, Lenore 
        McGregor as Susan and Lucie O'Brien as Karen, do an excellent job. Their 
        characterisations are credible and involving, and they produce a real 
        emotional shock in the end.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">________________________________________________________<br>
        <br>
        StageLeft Review:</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Deviations is subtitled "a stylish black comedy about 
        sex". This is only half the story; it's equally a serious piece about 
        lies, deliberate and inadvertent. Allen O'Leary's script strikes a delicate 
        balance of humour and tragedy and this production, from Canberra's Elbow 
        Theatre Company, is a deeply felt human drama. Richard (Michael Butcher) 
        and Susan (Lenore McGregor) are old friends and former lovers. He is an 
        embittered advertising copywriter and sometime poet, she a sharp-tongued 
        architect. They spend evenings playing Scrabble and good-naturedly tormenting 
        each other. Matt (Pip Branson) and Karen (Lucie O'Brien) are a young couple 
        whose relationship is foundering in a sea of misunderstandings and evasions. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The four lives become intertwined when Susan is smitten 
        by Karen upon meeting her in a cafe. Richard, meanwhile, strikes up a 
        conversation with Matt in a bar and is similarly beguiled. Karen doesn't 
        mention that she has a longtime boyfriend; Matt adopts a new name and 
        identity for his encounters with Richard, including a quasi-Buddhist outlook 
        and a terminal illness. This is fertile, if familiar, ground for comedy. 
        Karen and Matt contrive to keep their new relationships (his determinedly 
        platonic, hers less so) secret from each other, and their own relationship 
        hidden from Susan and Richard.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"> Beneath the snappy farce, however, Deviations has a strong 
        current of despair. The younger couple tell casual untruths in their separate 
        pursuits which they have to perpetuate to maintain the charade. Against 
        her better judgment, Susan becomes emotionally attached to her mysterious 
        new lover, and Richard gains a new lease on life through his involvement 
        with the stoic, doomed Matt. Or rather, Eric as he believes. Neither of 
        them realises just how false their perceptions of the pair are, and how 
        they have endowed them with attributes and motivations that are more projections 
        of their own needs. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Farce inevitably tips into tragedy, and it is a credit 
        to writer O'Leary that the script manages this transition with subtlety 
        and sureness. Deviations is played for the most part in short, punchy 
        bursts of drama. The expository opening scenes are a little mawkish, but 
        once the context and characters are established the play glows like an 
        incandescent lightbulb; though one fitted with a dimmer switch, judging 
        by the progressively darker hue of the text. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Performances are excellent and it's hard to single out 
        specific points of praise in such a fine ensemble - the dynamic between 
        all four actors lifts the play out of the ordinary. Deviations is a potent 
        new Australian play and this Elbow Theatre production does complete justice 
        to it. Reviewed by Aaron Jelbart. </font></p>
