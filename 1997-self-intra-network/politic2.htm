      <b>Net.Politic - the up-side</b> 
      <p> The issue of encryption is a good example of how net.politic can focus 
        quickly on one issue. <b>A contingent group assembled around one specific 
        non- partisan cause - the desire to show the US government that their 
        bit-depth &nbsp;<img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top"> 
        for a proposed encryption standard was too low</b>. The organisational 
        group distributed the code around many home PC's, and users set their 
        computers to crack in their down-time. The code was broken in a matter 
        of weeks.

    <td>This shows that net.activism can be effective in highlighting matters 
      of concern for users. The rapid dissemination the internet allows can work 
      fast enough to be useful, given that standard `feedback' loops are often 
      set purposefully short by authorities wanting to slip their program through 
      with the minimum of fuss. In such cases, <b>the `democratic' process is 
      far too slow to be creditable</b>; hard causes are cranked through and made 
      into legislation in the beginning and middle of any authorities term, the 
      soft causes are left to voting time, by which time changes have been set 
      in course which are then seen as `inevitable' by the public. </td>

      <p> Of course the Net, like any interest group, has it's price of admission, 
        it's demographic. An estimated 70% of net users are male, most users are 
        middle class, all must have enough spare time to use it. <b>Along with 
        this demographic comes the inevitable tide of commercialism, with large 
        companies already dominating the play in terms of content, use and creation.</b> 
        <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" align="top">&nbsp;In their 
        eyes the Net is just another media to dominate, and, sadly, they will 
        try their best to do it.

      <p> <b>The original `primitive tribes' of the net will become ghettos of 
        local colour. </b> Computer and Media companies alike will create a bland 
        new world of the net, and the original cyber-primitives - the hackers, 
        phreakers, geek girls, watchdogs, Mudders and Usegroups - will be relegated 
        to `also-ran' status in the battle for bandwidth, places where we might 
        stray in a brave moment after we've finished reading `The Whatever Herald' 
        on-line. <b>These places will seem as threatening and strange as dangerous 
        parts of town after dark.</b> We will pack our Virus Scanners, read a 
        guide on the local-lingo, and get ready to dodge a flame. We will proudly 
        name-drop in conversations to our friends, in an effort to get `net- cred', 
        without giving up our day-job freelancing as a net-worker, driving our 
        grader over the rubble in an effort to make the real-estate pay.
