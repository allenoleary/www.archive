        Fashion.</b> 
      <p>
      <b>Philosophy is marked by fashions as much as clothing, and Deleuze is a
      prime example.</b> Because mush of his work is only recently available in
      English, and because he is something of a rogue philosopher, he is only now
      becoming well known in English circles. Part of this lapse is due to the
      subjects he chose to write on; often his work uses marginal work to begin
      with, like the writings of Liebnez, Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergson, and then
      he tends to `give the finger' to accepted philosophical norms. 
      <p>
      Of course this makes him appealing for disciplines where the canon is held
      to be suspect or unimportant.<b> Deleuze is currently fashionable in Feminist,
      Queer, and Film studies, while the more widely available Derrida holds sway
      in English lit. </b>Philosophy departments only seem to have cottoned on
      recently, and even then only `rads' take him on (in Australia, Elizabeth
      Grosz offers a couple of courses, treating him on an equal footing with
      Foucault). It's notable that he gets no write up in any of the varieties
      of Philosophical dictionaries or guides available from Oxford or Cambridge
      Presses. My University, Swinburne, has two of his books.

    <td><b>The Pleasures of Philosophy.</b>
      <p>
      <b>Deleuze seems to have a joyfully trangressive air about his writings,
      and he openly offers his philosophy as a `tool kit' to be used by the reader,
      completely understanding that such uses may only be a partial understanding
      of the tools he offers (I fall into this category!)</b>. This, and the large
      range of subject matter he treats, tends to make him thought of as a `rebel
      without a causation', but this is wide of the mark. His early work, particularly
      `The Logic of Sense' and `Repetition and Difference', are rigorous examples
      of in-depth analysis on key concepts of the century; logic, language,
      signification. With this solid base and diversity, his work easily out classes
      better known names like Baudrillard or Bathes (there's an open offer to shoot
      me down...).

    <td><b>Reading Deleuze.</b>
      <p>
      Starting with Deleuze can be hard work until you get your head around the
      concepts, which takes a concerted effort. <b>Boiling him down is made almost
      impossible by his innate rejection of the idea of being summarised, and concepts
      like `The Body Without Organs' are notoriously problematic. </b>To look at
      the upside of this, he leaves you with a feeling of really having got to
      grips with something good, of having made a hard journey. <b>If Baudrillard
      could be considered a `Miami Wine Bar and Cadillac' thinker, then Deleuze
      is `Tent and Landrover' - all while well-dressed and deeply anti-authoritarian...
