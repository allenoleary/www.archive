      <p> <b>Fluency in symbolic and abstract thought enables us to engage in 
        very complex behaviors at a practical and imaginary level</b>, something 
        that we've always done in relation to the currently in vogue models of 
        how things work. The computer is a electronic Logical Manipulator that 
        uses the model of the algorithm developed by Bertrand Russell &nbsp;<img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" align="top"> 
        at the turn of the century to demonstrate how logic could have alternative 
        answers to the same question over a period of time. This idea was taken 
        by <a href="turing.htm"> </a>Alan Turing &nbsp;<img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" align="top"> 
        and made into five simple rules that govern all the internal logic of 
        a computer. From his first forays into cracking the `Enigma' code, Turing 
        recognised that <b>the computer could potentially mimic any other machine</b> 
        - even though his computer was hard-wired to solve one problem, it wasn't 
        long before flexibility (programmability) came into play.

      functions that I may not understand, but could be done by hand, take over

        and then <b>it can represent information in a way that helps in our symbolic 
        manipulations</b> (spreadsheet + drawing = graph). In this way the computer 
        lets us use more sophisticated words to describe what is happening; from 
        I run, to I represent, now we can add abstract (neural) words like `I 
        summarise', `I extrapolate', `I pattern'.
