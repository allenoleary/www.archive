        4. The Dominance of the Detached House</b></font></p>

        Historical Reasons for Detached Housing</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The reason why Australia 
        has disproportionately built detached housing, when most other countries 
        have built mainly medium density, has not been adequately researched. 
        It can be argued that it is a response to the system of provision that 
        has existed since white colonisation, which includes the following factors:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The long-time 
          existence of a small-scale building industry, often owner built, with 
          little expertise or few resources for constructing other housing forms;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The availability 
          of cheap and accessible land, which meant that there was little pressure 
          to develop alternative housing forms;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The dominance 
          of home ownership, with the corollary of a smaller rental sector. Landlords 
          prefer medium density housing as it is easier and cheaper to manage 
          than detached housing. The absence of the large private rental sector 
          of other countries meant that housing was commissioned for and by individual 
          households rather than large landlords;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A rapidly growing 
          population of migrants, mainly from dense inner city tenements and terraces, 
          who no doubt saw the detached house as symbolising a break with their 
          unpleasant pasts;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A facilitative 
          planning system characteristic of a market liberal society that enabled 
          – indeed, encouraged – urban sprawl, a form of urban development that 
          fits the detached house; and,</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Pressure on local 
          government to enact planning controls and covenants that prevented housing 
          other than the detached house from being developed in many parts of 
          our cities. This restricted medium density housing to certain areas, 
          mainly the inner city with its already established dense housing form.</font></li>
