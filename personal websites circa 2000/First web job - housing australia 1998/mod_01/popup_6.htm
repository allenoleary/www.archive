      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For various reasons, 
        the non-private housing stock in all countries up until the late 1970s 
        was managed in a rather bureaucratic style, even where cooperatives were 
        a large part of the stock. Subsequently there has been a push towards 
        management reforms. While the objectives may be the same – to make decision 
        making more client sensitive, to empower clients and to create greater 
        efficiency – the balance between these objectives and the appropriate 
        reforms is different from country to country. In Australia it has seen 
        a fostering of community housing as an alternative management approach 
        to public providers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The push for better 
        management is not just a public concern. Private renters have not necessarily 
        been served well in the private rental sector, with estate agencies treating 
        it as a side business to selling. In recent years there has been a push 
        towards more professional management of this sector.</font></p>
