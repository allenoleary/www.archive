      <b>But first, a definition...</b> 
      <p> The key thing about working&nbsp;as Networked Self is the notion of 
        suspension. 
      <p> <b>Suspension, as I define it, concerns the becoming involved in plateau 
        relationships without the desire to reach an immediate conclusion.</b> 
      <p> To reach a conclusion is to close the singularity down, &nbsp;to make 
        an enfoldment and drive yourself back onto the fascist attractor. If, 
        while involved in Net.Play you suddenly think, `this is not real, this 
        is not me', then you are fooling yourself - it was you a second ago, and 
        has already become part of your durational experience. 
      <p> Of course, holding off the moment of enfolding has a risk; life is more 
        comfortable when you think you know what's happening...

    <td><b>Some `suspended' people</b>. 
      <p> A second aspect of suspension is perhaps more esoteric; <b>suspension 
        has long been a primary function of extra-ordinary people.</b> 
      <p> It was said of Sir Isaac Newton <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;that 
        his genius was the ability to hold a problem in his mind for weeks at 
        a time, just floating with it until he could intuitively grasp its solution. 
        Likewise the example of the Buddah, who sat under a tree with the resolve 
        not to get up until he had achieved enlightenment, has a similar feel. 
        Looking at this from a soft-science point of view, it seems to be readily 
        acknowledged that <b>there is a certain wave-state (the `alpha wave' pattern) 
        where the mind becomes more open to `lucid-dreaming' and `creative' frames 
        of reference,</b> a kind of dissolution of hard-logic into a reflective 
        receptivity.

      paradigm of cause and effect, Newton was personally unsure that his discoveries 
      held all the answers, and it was left to Hume to make Newtons <i>Principia</i>&nbsp;into 
      a&nbsp;full system. He was also interested in alchemy, prophecy, gnosis 
      and wrote some 1.3 <i>million</i> words on theology.</font></td>

    <td> <b>As in suspension, so in love and passion.</b> 
      <p> To me, this idea of suspension has a similar feel to being in a love; 
        as you name it it is limited, as you experience it you have to give away 
        ideas of what `you' are: <b>If you are on to it, you let it open you out 
        rather than tie you up; as you are in it you realise that efforts to control 
        it are futile. </b>

    <td><b>Against the Transcendent principle.</b> 
      <p> It's important to note that suspension is not a transcendent principle 
        <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" align="Middle">&nbsp;in disguise; 
        the Buddha never tried to get above his experience, he just tried to realise 
        what it was, for him, right then. In this way Buddhism differs considerably 
        from institutionalism Christianity, which is defined, systematic and marketable. 
        There are notable exceptions of course, the Christian mystics usually 
        went beyond the Religions paradigm, much to the consternation of the church. 
        <b>The thing that intuitive thinkers, buddha, the mystics et al have in 
        common is this sort of thought: If this is where I am, then what is over 
        there?</b> That is they understand the current paradigm and try to step 
        across it's boundaries, to become the actual material of a phase-shift, 
        not merely float above it.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Considered in this way, the Network paradigm is just one among many, 
        but, crucially, it is historically favoured; it is ours, now, to play 
        with. </b> 
    </td>
    <td valign="Bottom" bgcolor="#f5e7c2" width="150"><b><font size="-1">Transcendence</font></b><font size="-1">: 
      `Go beyond, exceed limits of, rise above, surpass, excel'. Also in&nbsp;philosophy 
      an idea that doesn't derive from sense experience. It's a&nbsp;tricky concept 
      because often it's just way to apply force -&nbsp;viz the Church before 
      the reformation; accept your life now, because later you will go beyond.</font></td>
