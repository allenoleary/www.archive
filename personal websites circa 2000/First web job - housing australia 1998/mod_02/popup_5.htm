        2. Home Ownership in Australia</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>5&#9;Available 
        Land and an Appropriate Finance Industry</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In much of Europe, 
        the bulk of rural and urban land was owned by a small number of enormously 
        rich landed gentry who had little interest in subdividing it for individual 
        ownership. Ultimately, many did convert their land for residential purposes 
        and took on the role of private landlords, but they were reluctant to 
        give up their land for ownership. By contrast, Australia had no landed 
        gentry as the land was resumed from the Aboriginals who, without Western 
        concepts of private property and a legal system to support it, were seen 
        to have no rights to the land. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Land was purchased 
        by people who saw it as a mechanism for quick profits. As documented by 
        Michael Cannon (1966), a finance and development industry emerged in the 
        19th century which was geared to speculation in selling land for ownership. 
        This tradition, while moderated from the excesses of that era, is still 
        important today. The system of housing provision in Australia, consistent 
        with the country’s market liberal status, is still geared to the provision 
        and maintenance of ownership. Thus, the historical manner in which the 
        finance, development and building industries were structured here has 
        preordained Australia to be a home ownership nation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Those who migrated 
        to Australia wanted to own their own home, and this was matched by an 
        industry which was interested in selling land and houses for ownership. 
        Together with the supportive government policies since World War II, the 
        preconditions were in place for a home owning society.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In summary, then, 
        the dominance of ownership has no simple explanation, but rather is a 
        confluence of features; some have their origins in the pattern of settlement 
        in the 19th century and some reflect the characteristics of the era following 
        World War II, including relative equality of income, full employment, 
        high levels of migration and public policy. </font></p>
