essay discusses the visual characteristics of hypertext (space, contour, depth) 
by situating it, as an artistic form, in the literary traditions that it extends 
and modifies. While, from a literary perspective, hypertextuality is nothing 
new, what is revolutionary is the way that computerized hypertext emulates the 
spatial and visual qualities that literary texts have historically struggled to 
effect. To illustrate the concept of spatial form I have chosen to analyze the 
<A href="http://www.world3.com/meme1/Mola/index.html"><I>mola</I> web</A>, a 
hypertext which is unique, though not abnormal, in the extremity of its link 
structure. One needs only think of the ubiquitous metaphor of the labyrinth in 
hypertext criticism [5] or of the recent attention given to spatial user 
interfaces [17] to see how dependent is the idea of hypertext on a spatial form.

<P>
<DD>In his quest to visualize extra-dimensional space, the nineteenth-century 
German mathematician Georg Riemann developed a simple metaphor. Riemann proposed 
thinking of two sheets of paper--each one representing a discrete 
two-dimensional universe--pasted together exactly at the site of a small slice 
made in the center of each page. (Edge-on the sheets would look like a hyperbola 
whose two curves meet in the middle.) He then imagined a two-dimensional 
creature ambling across the outer surface of one sheet and passing through the 
aperture created by the joined slits. Moving from the top to bottom sheet, the 
creature in effect makes an extra-dimensional leap. It has moved from one 2-D 
flatland to another and, though this new world obeys the same physical laws as 
the old one, the bug is completely disoriented. The landscape is changed utterly 
but through no fault of the linearly-moving bug. To a three-dimensional observer 
the bug seems to have flipped upside down (though, unable to conceptualize up 
and down in its two-dimensionality, the bug would not perceive such a flip) 
[10]. Theoretically the bug has traveled "through" a hitherto unknown space; its 
movement has created a third dimension (if only momentarily) in a 2-D world. 
This space, the paradoxically empty rift between the two sheets, exists only in 
retrospection, in the knowledge that one is no longer where one began. To use a 
three-dimensional example: we do not ever see the elevator shaft through which 
we ascend in a building, though we know, through a process of inference, that we 
have moved through <EM>some </EM>space since the topography we are presented 
with when the doors re-open is noticeably different than the one we left in the 
lobby. The shaft, like the rift in flatland, is what Roman Ingarden calls an 
"imaginational space"[8]. It exists only because of our perceptual refusal to 
admit any spatial discontinuity in a Euclidean universe: we think space, 
therefore it is. 
<P></P>
<DD>Riemann's paper-based metaphor is useful to consider for two reasons, both 
of which grapple with the vexed and vexing relation between text and space. 
First, my verbal description of the warp known as "Riemann's cut" shows, 
crudely, the difficulty of conveying the concept of space with words alone (for 
instance, the diagram [Fig. 1] certainly relates the scene more clearly than the 
preceding verbal description). 
<P><IMG 
src="Ut Pictura Hyperpoesis, by John Tolva_files/flatbug.gif"><BR><STRONG>Fig 1: 
Riemann's Cut</STRONG> 
<P>The inability of language ever to create a spatial presence as vividly and 
precisely as pictorial representation may seem like a point not worth arguing. 
Yet, this descriptive limit is the essence of the many lines of 
distinction--mostly smudged by hypertext--traditionally drawn between the visual 
and verbal arts. Second, and more importantly, the model of the intersecting 
sheets of paper--parallel, interpenetrating planes connected by zero-length 
"worm holes"[3, 10]--is one way of visualizing link-rich text. Physicists call 
such a thing a "multiply connected surface"; we call it hypertext. 
<P></P>
<DD>Printed communication is the planar world of the bug. As the human interface 
with the text, our eyes--like the flatbug--scamper across the paperscape in one 
of two dimensions, up-down or left-right but never <EM>through</EM>; there is no 
depth. We may physically turn the page, but this act is peripheral to the 
reader-text transaction. (Who, for instance, actually recalls turning individual 
pages when reading a book?) Our perceptual machinery rides along the unicursal 
tracks of print-based syntax. But as nearly every commentator on hypertext has 
pointed out, the presence of links in a field of text disrupts the traditional 
flow, derailing cognition from syntactical linearity. Literary hypertext 
exploits the aesthetic possibilities of such disruption, both thematically and 
structurally. Like the cleft between flatland worlds, links add a spatial 
dimension to the primarily temporal medium of text, opening up a panorama of 
possibilities for the author. The act of traveling links, while not a function 
of the language itself, essentially <EM>creates </EM>space.

<P></P>
<DD>Let us succumb to temporal convention for the moment and begin at the 
beginning. Before discussing the spatial aspects of text and hypertext, the 
traditional distinctions between visual and verbal media--a kind of genealogy of 
the sister arts--must briefly be outlined. Ever since Lessing wrote his "Essay 
upon the Limits of Poetry and Painting" in 1766, students of the visual and 
verbal arts have struggled to subvert his separation of the two modes into the 
categories of space and time [13]. Visual art--an iris by <A 
href="http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~jntolva/okeefe.html">O'Keefe</A>, a kiss by 
<A href="http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~jntolva/rodin.html">Rodin</A>, a 
monochrome by <A 
href="http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~jntolva/adams.html">Adams</A>--all these 
forms exist in space and as such are apprehended by the viewer nearly 
instantaneously. Conversely, verbal art--an elegy by <A 
href="http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~jntolva/donne.html">Donne</A>, a novel by <A 
href="http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~jntolva/austen.html">Austen</A>, a tale by <A 
href="http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~jntolva/twain.html">Twain</A>--all forms with 
little intrinsic physical space, must by necessity be read during an interval of 
time. Thus, the spatial/visual arts are characterized by the simultaneity of 
signs (color), while the temporal/verbal arts are characterized by the 
succession of signs (language). So with this historic, if somewhat unstable, 
distinction we ask: what does it mean for words to approach the condition of 
visuality? Put another way, what is the consequence of poetry, <EM>poesis</EM>, 
functioning <EM>ut pictura</EM>, as a painting does? The traditional 
interpretation of Horace's statement is that the expressive potential of poetry 
aspires to the condition of painting, that is, to the condition of unmediated 
representation of the natural world. This search for the "natural sign"--the 
symbol so transparent that its artifice is indistinguishable from reality--is 
most easily recognized in the current cultural craze for virtual realities and 
other hyperreal forms of delusion. Yet, this impulse is also the motive 
traditionally assigned to any verbal construct (most often poetry) that seems 
self-consciously to be emulating or evoking a static, visual (and hence 
painting-like) moment. 
<P></P>
<DD>How is this done? One way is to reject what Stuart Moulthrop calls the "<A 
href="http://www.ubalt.edu/www/ygcla/sam/pillows.html#verbality">delusion of 
verbality</A>" and acknowledge that, in fact, "the word is a image after 
all"[17]? Some examples of literally making writing visible or spatial thus 
include calligraphy, pictograms, concrete poetry, and rebus puzzles. These 
marginalized forms acknowledge the word as an image like anything else and so 
exploit the possibilities inherent in its physicality. Text on a screen, in its 
very malleability, has affinities with this kind of word art. Changing a 
typeface and formatting for a certain kind of emphasis are both ways of charging 
words with visual meaning. 
<P></P>
<DD>An adjunct category of visible writing is illuminated writing in which text 
is usually accompanied by a frame of visual information and decoration. 
Elaborate marginal glossing and intertextual patterning often made illuminated 
medieval works as beautiful as they were unreadable. Contemporary multimedia and 
hypermedia, in which visual elements are woven into the virtual fabric of 
text-based documents, obviously owe much to the tradition of illustrated 
manuscripts. (Indeed, the digital environment reduces all its components to the 
binary code of 1's and 0's and encourages thinking of the sister arts as 
identical twins at the most fundamental level.) Perhaps the truest verbal 
yearning for the representative power of the visual arts is demonstrated in a 
small sub-genre of literature that employs the rhetorical device known as 
ekphrasis. "Ekphrasis," explains W.J.T. Mitchell, is used "as a model for the 
power of literary art to achieve formal, structural patterns and to represent 
vividly a wide range of perceptual experiences, most notably the experience of 
vision"[14]. Keat's "Ode on a Grecian Urn" is the archetypal example of 
ekphrasis: it evokes a visual stasis and vividness solely through words. But, 
since ekphrastic evocation is wholly a function of the linguistic elements of 
the text and so has no unique correlative in hypertext--a medium whose 
distinguishing characteristic, the link, is a non-linguistic unit--it does not 
directly concern us here. I will, however, return to the idea of ekphrasis in 
the discussion of the <I>mola</I> web. But what about "regular" hypertext, 
unadorned link-rich text? How do we account for the undeniable sense that we are 
navigating some kind of space when we are reading hypertext? 
<P></P>
<DD>Verbal space is a perceptual effect, an artistic sleight of hand. In the 
same year that Vannevar Bush proposed the "memex," a machine used for spatial 
organization and retrieval of (mostly textual) information, Joseph Frank offered 
a definition of spatial form in literature that persists today [1, 6]. Frank 
called the spatializing technique a "deliberate disconnectedness," an "art of a 
thing continually alluding to itself, continually breaking off short." In this 
formulation, the act of reading proceeds through time as usual, but the 
fragmented nature and sheer density of allusion in the literature of Pound, 
Eliot, Joyce and others gives up "syntactical sequence . . . for a structure 
depending on the perception of relationships between disconnected word-groups." 
By its very nature a phenomenon apprehended in re-reading, textual spatiality 
defies effective demonstration by quotation. Nevertheless I have selected a 
relatively compact passage from T.S. Eliot's <EM>The Wasteland</EM> that 
implies, if it does not totally portray, the kind of space that inheres in 
juxtaposition and repetition: 
<P><PRE>		
	Here is no water but only rock
	Rock and no water and the sandy road
	The road winding above among the mountains
	Which are mountains of rock without water
	If there were water we should stop and drink
	Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think
	Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand
	If there were only water amongst the rock
	Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit
	Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit
	There is not even silence in the mountains
	But dry sterile thunder without rain
	There is not even solitude in the mountains
	But red sullen faces sneer and snarl
	From doors of mudcracked houses
				If there were water
	And no rock
	If there were rock
	And also water
	And water
	A spring
	A pool among the rock
	If there were the sound of water only
	Not the cicada
	And dry grass singing
	But sound of water over a rock
	Where the hermit thrush sings in the pine trees
	Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop
	But there is no water</PRE>
<P>The relentless iteration of themes and motifs and the stutter-step of the 
narrative flow freeze the moment perceptually, creating a complementary space 
outside of the poem (in the reader's mind). "To be properly understood," Frank 
continues, "these word-groups must be juxtaposed with one another and perceived 
simultaneously; only when this is done can they be adequately understood; for 
while they follow one another in time, their meaning does not depend on this 
temporal relationship." 
<P></P>
<DD>This, of course, is exactly what happens when reading hypertext. The space 
we seem to be maneuvering is "imaginational." Like bugs in flatland, we 
momentarily extend the traditionally linear (i.e., 2-D) reading act into a third 
dimension when we travel a link. The generous possibilities for linking in 
hypertext fiction and poetry create all the more opportunity for the reader to 
engage in this sense of extra-dimensional reading. In its simplest form, 
hypertext narrative evokes space by undermining chronological order and causal 
relationships. What dense allusion and repetition achieve in modernist poetics 
is technically emulated, indeed made more complex by, hypertext structures. As 
Michael Joyce has argued, the hypertext author and the reader together create a 
sense of textual contour. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Contours are discovered sensually and most often they are read in 
  the visual form of the verbal, graphical or moving text. These visual forms 
  may include the apparent content of the text at hand; its explicit and 
  available design; or implicit and dynamic designs which the current reader or 
  writer perceives either as patterns, juxtapositions or recurrences within the 
  text or as abstractions situated outside the text [9].</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The author creates links, designates the paths along which the reader may 
travel, and thus, in a much freer manner than modernist authors, structures the 
network of allusions, parallelisms, and juxtapositions that contribute to the 
sense of textual space. Rather than only perceiving stasis in the act of 
connecting an allusion from two disconnected parts of a modernist poem, the 
hypertext reader, following a link on her own volition, senses that she has 
actually traveled to the new space. Hypertext externalizes the cognitive mapping 
of disconnected word-groups that is a pre-requisite for the sense of space in 
modernist literature, what we might call non-computerized hypertext. Space in 
hypertext is still imaginational, for a literal spatial representation would 
become a virtual reality based merely on the organizational principles of 
hypertext. Yet, it is a more vivid, more tangible space that we inhabit (or 
perhaps, that inhabits us) when we have (or think we have) a greater control 
over the reading process. (The graphical manipulation of lexias and the iconic 
depiction of structural features, of course, adds to the reader's sense of 
spatial presence as well.) Hypertext undermines the temporality of the verbal 
arts because the fundamental and unavoidable linearity of the act of reading 
often convinces us that we are moving sequentially when we are, in fact, only 
circling, spiraling, weaving in and out. Oscillating thus, we perceive any piece 
of art as both a spatial <EM>and </EM>a temporal construction, a singularity of 
Einsteinian spacetime. A text is spatial insofar as its perception requires 
grappling with its physically written (and not orally delivered) state; 
likewise, an image is temporal insofar as its perception takes place in time. 
So, hypertext does not create new problems in the tidy distinctions between 
visuality and verbality; it merely complicates them exponentially.

<P></P>
<DD>One particularly rich example of dimensional complication is the <I>mola</I> 
web, a hypertext created by Carolyn Guyer, Michael Joyce, Nigel Kerr, Nancy Lin, 
and Suze Schweitzer and placed on the World Wide Web [15]. This eminently 
collaborative hypertext capitalizes on the features (and exploits the 
limitations) of the global network and its commercial interfaces known as 
browsers. While the Web is certainly not the only hypertext environment 
available for creative writing, and though it is fraught with shortcomings, its 
use as an arena for serious literary hypertext is a relatively new and 
unexplored one. Hypertext of <EM>all </EM>kinds exhibits spatial form to some 
degree; that this essay considers only one hypertext network (viewed with one of 
many available interfaces) should not be taken to mean that I consider it the 
only, or even a representative, example. Like any hypermedia environment, the 
World Wide Web presents authors with unique opportunities for evoking spatial 
form and visuality. 
<P></P>
<DD>Useful to consider before examining the <I>mola</I> is that its "context," 
the World Wide Web, operates (for better or for worse) on an unabashedly bookish 
metaphor. Individual screens are almost universally referred to as "pages" and, 
though there may be no causal or linear organization to these pages, the reader 
is encouraged to move forward and backward among them just as in a book. There 
is, then, a tension inherent in web-based hyperfiction since any spatial form 
generated by the links must necessarily work against the sense of linear 
pagination encouraged by the web and its browsers. The <I>mola</I> web 
nevertheless flies in the face of this structure by making multiple "slices" in 
every page. It is a collection of sheets comprised totally of Riemann's cuts: 
<EM>every single word and image yields</EM>. Everything is linked; nothing lies 
outside of the web; surface equals depth. A graphical lexia called "Moure" 
posits the question "if there is a name surface, then what else is there? is 
what is ‘different' from the surface depth or is it another surface?" In fact, 
the story behind the web's name, <I>mola</I>, belies its strange surface 
configuration. The authors describe a <I>mola</I> as 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a fabric panel which has been layered, often very complexly, in 
  reverse-appliqué patterns or images and used as the bodice section of the 
  blouses worn by the Kuna women of Panama. The few records of the time indicate 
  that when Europeans reached Panama in the 17th century, the Kuna women 
  probably did not cover their upper bodies but instead painted them in 
  geometric designs. It is possible that missionaries persuaded them to transfer 
  their traditional torso paintings to decorated clothing [15e].</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thus, the history of the quilt pattern is one of surfaces yielding to one 
another, from dermal to external to hypertextual. Already there is a spatial 
paradigm which we may superimpose to guide our reading experience. But no 
paradigms are needed really; the totally linked surface offers ample opportunity 
for the reader to travel the rifts between the textual flatlands, momentarily to 
create new dimensions. 
<P></P>
<DD>The <I>mola</I> web is a surface multiply folded in upon itself, allowing 
the reader/viewer to move in any direction from any unit. In a lexia called "The 
Plan" Joyce explains, "The idea is that we make a web page where there are three 
levels: the <I>mola</I>, the texts, the scraps. Each of the first two is linked 
across its entire surface (that is every part of the graphics, every word of the 
text). . . The idea was to defuse (diffuse) the hierarchy by spatializing the 
links"[15a] As in unlinked text, this spatialization is effected perceptually, 
imaginationally. A lexia called "linking heuristic" says it succinctly: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The linear is merely a stronger local compulsion, i.e., situated 
  time represented spatially, and so it is represented here, where (whenever) it 
  is needed, by repeated (though separated) instances of links to the same place 
  [15b].</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hypertextual reiteration--not merely remembered as when the reader travels 
along linearly in a print narrative--but actual and <EM>experienced</EM>, 
spatializes the links; or, rather, the links spatialize the reiteration. 
Sequence gives way to reversibility, as in a piece of visual art. Yet, there is 
more than spatial form to this project. The <I>mola</I> web is hypertext taken 
to its logical extreme--exhaustive linking--and at this extremity we find that, 
amid the tangle of discourse, distinctly visual patterns rise to the surface. 
<P></P>
<DD>Let us start the exploration of the web at what is described as the "front 
door." The patchwork components of the hypertext (including fiction, 
documentary, song lyrics, transcribed conversation, graphics, and links to 
external sites) collectively define the "weave" (an etymological pun on the word 
"text"), but the <I>mola</I> proper [Fig. 2] is the captionless image that 
begins the hypertext and which acts as a kind of synoptic point of entry into 
the text-block appliqué. 
<P><A href="http://www.world3.com/cgi-bin/imagemap/meme1/Mola/mola.map"><IMG 
isMap src=""></A> <BR><STRONG>Fig 2: The <EM><I>mola</I> </EM>"map"</STRONG> 
<P>Ten distinct sections, each a flat meander-like pattern suggesting the 
meta-symbol of hypertext, the labyrinth, comprise the map. Placed over the seams 
are five "signature stamps," one for each of the authors, which are linked to 
personal text spaces that act, in the words of Joyce, as "stitches" for the 
weave. The center patch, which links to Kerr's signature, presents the outline 
of a hand poised as though about to tap a button on an unseen mouse: an iconic 
beckoning to enter the web. 
<P></P>
<DD>With a mouse click on the map the reader slides into the (mostly) textual 
strata of the web. Though they may be portions of larger phrase-based links, 
every word, except headers, can be explored. Revealing another debt to the model 
of print, many current graphical interfaces for the World Wide Web designate 
fixed (non-hyperlinked) text by using an ink-black font color. Such words occur 
only rarely in the <I>mola</I> (usually in the headers) and their fixity seems 
as clumsily misplaced as the lone hyperlink in a long electronic text. The 
<I>mola</I> forces the reader to notice the interface, to look <EM>at 
</EM>rather than <EM>through </EM>what Richard Lanham calls the "maximally 
self-conscious" surface [12]. Perhaps the best example of this 
self-consciousness comes from the signaling of links. Current graphical browsers 
usually represent links in two ways, by underlining and by changing the color of 
the text. The only difference between the two methods is that underlining alerts 
the reader to the boundaries of the individuated link-chunks. To be sure, this 
will change as the web adopts more sophisticated link structures. But for now 
the clumsiness of the interface, this "momentary advantage of our awkwardness," 
(to recycle a comment by Joyce) creates irony: the underline subtly reifies the 
linearity of the reading act, which, of course, wholly works at odds with the 
fluid, dynamic architecture of a hypertext like the <I>mola</I>. I thus find the 
<I>mola</I> web much more aesthetically palatable (and less linearly determined) 
by deselecting the link underlining on the browser. Lost with this move are the 
link delimiters, but gained is a new, totally word-based texture to the quilt, 
one that de-emphasizes the horizontal nature of textual syntax and lets the 
vertical and diagonal patterns of the multi-colored words emerge.

<P></P>
<DD>This patterning--the <EM>literally </EM>visual aspect of the <I>mola</I> 
web--derives from the three-part color scheme that some browsers use to 
differentiate various states of links. For example, the Netscape Navigator 
browser uses blue to denote a link to a lexia that has not previously been 
visited, purple for links to areas already encountered, and red for the fleeting 
moment of tactile interaction when the mouse clicks on the text. These colors 
can be assigned by author or reader, though in the <I>mola</I> web their default 
values are used throughout. Thus, as readers move through the text spaces, 
circling back to previously visited lexias or encountering new "pages" that 
contain links to previously visited lexias, the once-monochromatic text fields 
slowly cleave and coalesce into a two-tone patchwork. Like dog-earing, that 
patently visual and mildly intimate mark of the reader upon book-based text, the 
color-shifting of the <I>mola</I> charts the reader's temporal progress. The 
ratio of one color to the other plots the amount of the web that the reader has 
encountered. As the reader moves around the web, the visited link color scheme 
seems to bubble to the surface, subsuming its counterpart. 
<P></P>
<DD>The patterns of the weave are wholly functions of the browser's denotation 
of lexias visited, <EM>not </EM>of the links used to get to them. Thus though 
the text steadily morphs into a uniform dog-eared purple, the reader can never 
be sure that he has traversed each and every link. Also, unlike dog-earing, the 
color switch is always in a state of flux. Eventually the browser's list of 
visited links--an analogue to the weaver's schematic for building a 
quilt--resets itself, returning the text to the original, undifferentiated 
pattern of blue. Like a book that perpetually flattens out its dog-ears and 
rehabilitates its spine, the <I>mola</I> periodically re-dresses itself, 
assuring that the visual stasis of the patterning at least occasionally submits 
to the fluidity of the medium. 
<P></P>
<DD>The act of reading itself, and nothing inherent to the hypertext, 
precipitates the visual designs in the <I>mola</I> web. As in a 
splatter-painting by Jackson Pollack, what emerges from seeming chaos is 
distinct, though random, pattern--what Joyce calls "contour." In an essay called 
"Poem Descending a Staircase," William Dickey brings the issue to the fore. He 
writes not about the World Wide Web but about HyperCard, an earlier page-based 
hypertext system: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whatever underlying pattern or geometry is built into the poem 
  will not immediately be apparent to the viewer, who can encounter only one 
  word at a time; the recognition of such structure can come only gradually, so 
  that the viewer's apprehension of the visual and the conceptual shape of the 
  poem is generated in the process of viewing it, rather than appearing as an 
  initial given. The sense of chance, of an aleatory element affecting the 
  viewer's understanding of the work, has been incorporated as a fundamental 
  element of the poem [2]. 
  <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Dickey here alludes to the <EM>experientially </EM>visual 
aspect of hypertext. As in a painting, the act of viewing the <I>mola</I> web is 
associative. The eye naturally jumps from color patch to color patch, not 
resting on the individual words for more than a few seconds. Reading the 
<I>mola</I> linearly (that is, focusing on the words <EM>as words</EM>) 
necessarily comes after the associative act of viewing. After a while the 
reader/viewer actively searches for the blue (pristine, unvisited) text just as 
an art critic peers hard to find new items, textures, and colors in a painting 
or sculpture. Indeed there is chance (what Dickey calls the "aleatory element") 
involved in this process, for nothing the authors could hard-wire into their 
creation can dictate the path that the reader follows. Words suggestive of 
links, visual cues to links, and especially guard fields have traditionally 
insured that the author had some degree of control over the reader's trek. 
Because there can be nothing suggestive of a hyperlink when everything is one 
and because the World Wide Web in general disallows conditional linking, the 
authors of the <I>mola</I> have no such tools at their disposal, but they don't 
seem to mind. An untitled lexia comments: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The concept of hypertext is mercurial because it is unstructured. 
  The reader is the structure, the builder, and the architect, and in this 
  creation, it has created life. The burden of clarification is lightened 
  because there is less of a need for clear cut answers. The answers are a 
  product of creation [15c]. 
  <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>It quickly becomes clear that interactivity and chance (the 
interactivity <EM>of</EM> chance as well as the chance of interactivity) define 
the contours of the <I>mola</I>. One particularly apt example: among the 
so-called level of "scraps" in the <I>mola</I>--links to external sites on the 
World Wide Web--is a site called URouLette, that actually lands the reader at a 
randomly selected server anywhere in the world.

<P></P>
<DD>Even a hypertext as seemingly chaotic as the <I>mola</I> can be explored 
logically. As J. Yellowlees Douglas has noted, the drive toward establishing 
cohesion and closure persists even in hypertext. Our desire for order "is 
satisfied when we manage to resolve narrative tensions and to minimize 
ambiguities, to explain puzzles, and to incorporate as many of the narrative 
elements as possible into a coherent pattern"[4]. Yet, the question of the 
<I>mola</I> quilt's intrinsic structural order is not satisfied by recourse to 
the reader's perceptual act of organization. Another untitled lexia offers this 
explanation: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Hypertext is a reflection of the entropy that exists in the 
  universe. We, the artists, try to create order, but at the same moment this 
  adds to randomness for we continuously change the meaning, the form of our 
  creation. As we create more randomness in structure, there is more order in 
  our minds. Life appears hectic and chaotic to the observer; however, it is 
  actually habitual and sane to the "artist," much like hypertext. . . . [15d] 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Drawing an analogy between the second law of thermodynamics and creative 
endeavor, we might call hypertext as an art form a mirror of life's 
disarticulation. On the visual level, the <I>mola</I> quilt does exhibit an 
entropic tendency: it slowly loses its uniformity of color, bleeding into a 
matrix of <EM>tachiste</EM>-like swatches. The reader's attempt to navigate in a 
systematic manner disrupts the colored uniformity of the parts while 
simultaneously triggering the emergence of patterns--itself a re-ordering. Yet, 
given enough time and exploration, the quilt inexorably reverts to a single 
color. Absolute zero, entropy's end. Visual closure exists. (At least it exists 
for a while, until the reader switches browsers or resets the link list.) 
Closure can be achieved in another, more surreal way too. The reader could 
conceivably match the color of the visited link text to the color of the 
background. Each encounter of a text-space would then effectively obliterate all 
references to that text-space. The gray substratum would swallow the text whole, 
assimilating its pixels into the uniform texture of its canvas. Like William 
Gibson's electronic text <EM>Agrippa (A Book of the Dead)</EM> that erases 
itself after it has been read, the <I>mola</I> would literally be a 
self-consuming artifact, slowly disintegrating into nothingness. The lexias to 
which the vanishing links refer would still exist (though, made up of links, 
they too would begin to dissolve) and the link foreshadowing would continue to 
work. (To be sure, the reader could just as easily set the color of 
<EM>unvisited </EM>link text to match the background, thereby assuring a slow 
<EM>materialization </EM>of the text from the screen's blank background.) 
<P></P>
<DD>Even accounting for the intriguing possibilities of such color assignments, 
the <I>mola</I> web (given enough time) still inexorably cycles from order to 
disorder and back again. In spite of the intrinsically hypertextual preclusion 
of narrative closure in the <I>mola</I> web there is a peculiar impulse to 
visual completeness--one ostensibly tied to the completeness of the reader's 
experience. Relevant here is the ancient distinction in the visual arts between 
<EM>hyle</EM>, matter itself, and <EM>morphe</EM>, the form imposed upon it. 
Disproportionate amounts of the former--heavy, distinct brush strokes in a 
painting for instance-- emphasize the process of creation, highlight the status 
of the representation as an artifact. Claude Gandelman, in <EM>Reading Pictures, 
Viewing Texts</EM>, extends this notion to the verbal arts: "<EM>hyle </EM>can 
be shown as collage: pasting newspaper clippings within the literary text, a 
technique used by Dos Passos, or pasting together bits of conversation heard on 
the street, as in the poem conversations of Apollinaire. . . . It introduces 
"noise" into the art work in the shape of the seesaw game between two 
systems"[7]. As a verbal work, the <I>mola</I> web is nearly pure <EM>hyle</EM>, 
"tantamount," Gandelman says of the aesthetics of unfinishedness, "to a 
foregrounding of disorder over order, or randomness and noise over 
organization." Yet, we know that the trajectory of the weave is toward visual 
completeness and chromatic uniformity. Readers are compelled to explore each 
untraveled link, to separate the signal from the noise, to suppress all the 
textual "spots of indeterminacy" (<EM>Unbestimmtheitstellen</EM>), Roman 
Ingarden's term for the interstices of meaning in a textual composition. The 
reader finally creates a space in which to situate the quilt. 
<P></P>
<DD>The <I>mola</I> web participates fully in the spatio-temporal dialectic of 
modernist art. Self-consciously desiring to create space through juxtaposition, 
reiteration, and allusion, the quilted hypertext is a giant, möbius surface of 
links. It is, in this woven way, truly ekphrastic. That is, the patchwork 
symbolic structure of the <I>mola</I>--links and words taken as a whole--not 
only describes a quilt, it literally evokes one. What could be more quilt-like 
than a spatialized weaving together of lexias? Rather than disrupting the 
concept of spatial form as some critics have argued [3], links generate it, 
thwarting temporal flow and opening a space for the reader's mind to construct 
the extra dimension needed to rationalize the act of "traveling" a link in a 
Euclidean universe that physically, logically disallows it. We think space, 
therefore it is.
