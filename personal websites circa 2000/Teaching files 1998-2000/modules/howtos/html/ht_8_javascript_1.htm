      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Idea</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JavaScript 
        was invented to enable the browser and html to talk to one another and 
        allow more sophisticated interactivity than point and click.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Basic 
        Concepts</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JavaScript 
        is what's called an inline or scripting language, as opposed to a compiled 
        language. Consider the difference between a html page which you can always 
        read and a compiled director movie, which you cannot.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JavaScript 
        is not Java. The two are almost totally unrelated as Java is an industrial 
        strength compiled programming environment. They share a name only because 
        it was a convenient marketing move when it was released. It was originally 
        developed by Netscape and called LiveScript.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DHTML (dynamic 
        html) is a combination of html 4 (including advanced style sheets), JavaScript 
        and what's called the DOM (document object model). JavaScript and dhtml 
        still only operate on a page by page basis, there is no way to carry information 
        from page to page without using a 'proper' programming/scripting environment 
        like ASP or ColdFusion. The implementations of dhtml work slightly differently 
        across browsers (big surprise...)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What can 
        you do with it?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Basic things 
        include rollovers and opening sized browser windows, changing two pages 
        at once in a frameset. You can also use JavaScript to write html into 
        a page when it is loaded by the browser, like the current date or time. 
        More advanced uses include cascading menus, dynamic graphs, and simple 
        games. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More complicated 
        programming tasks like linking to databases are handled by active scripting 
        languages, while small stand-alone programs can be created with Java</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We'll be 
        doing some of the basics...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How does 
        it work?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JavaScript 
        is something that is actually done by the browser. As the browser reads 
        (or parses) the html page it assembles an abstract picture of the documents 
        structure in accordance with a set of rules called the DOM (Document Object 
        Model) These are called the properties. You write the JavaScript to get 
        the browser to perform certain tasks with the DOM when certain things 
        happen, like change which image is loaded in the browser when a mouse 
        rolls over it - an image flip: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>properties</b> 
          of the DOM are manipulated with <b>methods</b> triggered by <b>events</b>.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We'll go 
        through what this means in more detail in class...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also note 
        that the browser must be JavaScript compatible (and have it switched on 
        in preferences!).</font></p>
