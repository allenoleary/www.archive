        2. Home Ownership in Australia</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">3. 
        Government Policy</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A popular line of 
        argument in the 1970s and 1980s, which was given considerable prominence 
        by Kemeny’s influential book, was<i> </i>that the desire for ownership 
        is a response to government policy. He and others documented the many 
        postwar policies which encouraged ownership and, by contrast, the relative 
        absence of support for public and private rental. Regulated low mortgage 
        interest rates, subsidies to first homebuyers and the absence of capital 
        gains tax have all been identified as factors encouraging ownership. There 
        is no doubt that such policies had their impact in reinforcing ownership 
        in the postwar era, but they fail to explain why home ownership was important 
        in earlier years when it had little government support.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The success of one 
        tenure cannot be considered in isolation from others. If another tenure 
        is perceived to be more attractive than home ownership for various reasons, 
        then ownership may not prosper. This has not been the case in Australia. 
        One reason for the lesser importance of ownership in many European societies 
        has been the growth of social housing. With the size of this sector going 
        up to around 40 per cent in, for example, the Netherlands and Sweden, 
        home ownership by comparison just has to be squeezed out. In Australia, 
        where political decisions have kept the social sector small, there was 
        no threat to home ownership. This is of indirect importance to ownership, 
        but still does not explain its dominance in the 20th century.</font></p>
