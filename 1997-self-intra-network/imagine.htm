      <b>Identity - real or imaginary?</b>
      <p>
      It's one of my chief assumptions that <b>the mind makes little differentiation
      between the `real' and the `imaginary'</b>, that the two things interact
      which each other in a way that is inclusive and active, not rational.
      <p>
      <b>To read a novel is to have an experience just as surely as walking to
      the milk bar;</b> conversely walking to the milkbar can strike you as an
      imaginary event, just as easily as you can imagine having a conversation
      with someone and then believe `really' that you've already had it when you
      meet that person next.

    <td>This is not an original thought, of course, and it's history can be traced 
      back for as long as the production of imaginary events have taken place, 
      for which we can include religious ritual, theatre or magic. More recently 
      w can look to the work work of French Philosopher, Henri Bergson. <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;One 
      of his basic idea was that of `duree, or duration. He asserts that <b>time 
      is experienced differently in the subject that it is in the objective world 
      of scientific materialism.</b> 
      <p>
      In 19th C science, time was structured through the use of space and was absolute
      and precisely measurable. However <b>it was Bergson's contention that the
      subject experienced time as duration, as a spread of events which could be
      constituted from many sources, the real, the imaginary, the emotional, and
      which had it's own temporal feel.</b>

      Hugely influential at the beginning of the 1900's, Bergsons was&nbsp;a positive 
      philosophy, based on the idea of <i>the elan vital</i>. In Bergson the scientific 
      urge is seen as&nbsp;a reduction of the nature of life. <br>

      <p>
      <b>`Becoming' is Bergson's notion of the subjects sense of `Duree' combined
      with the directionality of subjective experience and an `elan vital'.</b>
      In his world, `becoming' is an evolutionary event; the bland computations
      of Darwin's evolutionary system are given the fresh spin of purpose. Bergson
      also believed that this evolutionary purpose could not be predicted in advance
      and operated in a momentary and inspired way, <b>systems burst onto a new
      line of development of their own volition.</b> These notions sit very neatly
      with the `basins of attraction' and `phase shifts' of Chaos theory.</td>
