        Small Proportions of Medium Density Housing</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The peak period for 
        its construction in Australia was 1965-75, mainly in the form of blocks 
        of flats, or what are referred to in Queensland as ‘six packs’, given 
        their approximation to a six pack of beer. For a variety of reasons, this 
        design fell into decline and has only staged a resurgence in recent years. 
        This resurgence is mainly an inner urban one, driven by changing lifestyles 
        and demographics and by the economic reality for some households that 
        the single detached house, at least in inner urban areas, is not affordable. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It is not only consumers 
        who are discovering the merits of medium density housing. All levels of 
        government, for a combination of economic and environmental reasons, have 
        come to appreciate that our existing pattern of low density development 
        must be modified. In particular, recognition of the high costs of infrastructure 
        provision on the urban fringe has encouraged a view that greater use should 
        be made of existing urban infrastructure. The inner areas of our cities 
        are seen as having considerable potential for <i>urban consolidation</i>. 
        There are many pockets of underutilised land (although these are rapidly 
        being depleted) as a result of changing economic activity, such as the 
        relocation of manufacturing and warehousing to outer urban areas. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The process of urban 
        consolidation, which at the moment is essentially a policy of medium density 
        housing, is an inevitable response to a local, national and world environment 
        which is very different to that of previous decades. Unfortunately, it 
        is often difficult for people immersed in the demands of their daily lives 
        to appreciate that we have entered a new economic, social and urban order 
        – an order increasingly called the <i>postmodernist </i>world to distinguish 
        it from the <i>modern</i> world of sustained economic growth and expansive 
        government that characterised the postwar years up to the 1970s.</font></p>
