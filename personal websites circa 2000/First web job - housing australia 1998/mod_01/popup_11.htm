        Low Income</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Any discussion of 
        low income housing policy and affordability must give some attention to 
        the incidence of low income and its most extreme manifestation, poverty, 
        as well as the determinants of this incidence. This is not an easy task 
        as there are difficulties both in defining income and attributing causal 
        connections. Direct income for an individual or household is derived from 
        participation in the formal labour market or, if outside the market, by 
        income support from the state, for example, pensions and benefits. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Indirectly, income 
        can be determined by the degree and form of the social wage, that is, 
        goods and services provided free of charge or at subsidised prices which 
        increase a person’s or household’s disposable income relative to consumption 
        of these goods and services at market values. Education, health care, 
        child care and public transport are characteristic of social wage goods. 
        The cumulative effects of labour market income, income support and the 
        social wage can create very different income positions between societies. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Market liberal societies 
        such as the United States and Australia, with their relatively unregulated 
        and flexible labour markets, can have people working at much lower incomes 
        for a given position than more regulated and centralised markets such 
        as the social democratic societies of Europe. Moreover, income support 
        benefits tend to be lower, so there is greater poverty. Thus, the proportion 
        of persons and households requiring low income housing assistance may 
        be greater in market liberal societies. How this is handled in policy 
        terms is a complex issue as there are two broad means: to subsidise people 
        into private rental housing through rent assistance, or to construct social 
        housing and subsidise people by allocating them such housing. Which is 
        best has long been debated, but Australia is currently moving from the 
        latter to the former.</font></p>
