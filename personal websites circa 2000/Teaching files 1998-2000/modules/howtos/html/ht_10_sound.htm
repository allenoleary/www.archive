        Sound in Dreamweaver </font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As there 
        are no html tags to place sounds into WebPages, all the approaches use 
        JavaScript and (often) the &lt;embed&gt;tag to get sound into html pages. 
        The very easiest to incorporate a background sound track is actually to 
        use a flash movie with sound only in it and embed it on the page with 
        a little code to check if the Flash player is present. You can also insert 
        code that will specifically address the Windows Media Player, or the Netscape 
        Live Audio plugin, but these are obviously biased in favour of operating 
        systems and browsers. There are several approaches to getting sound into 
        the events of your page across all browsers: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Basic 
        Linking: </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Using a 
        link to a sound file in a Url instead of a page should pass the sound 
        file to the default player of the browser. This will mean the browser 
        will pop-up a player in it's own window to handle the sound. If it's in 
        a non-streaming format, the whole file will have to download before it 
        plays. Note: Depending on how you have the browser setup and what plugins 
        are available, this linking method may take you to another page, which 
        then plays the file… </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Exercise: 
        · Download a common file format sound file (.au or .aif for Mac) and save 
        it into your working folder.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Make a new

        &lt;embed&gt; tag.</font></p>

        that are not handled by the Default Player can lead to all sorts of problems. 
        Players are getting better at handling MP3's and so forth, but you have 
        to rely on the user having the correct player loaded. For instance this 
        embed works on my PC at home because it is handled my Windows Media Player 
        7, but may give you nothing today depending what is installed on the lab 
        Macs...</font></p>

        Net Radio is handled with Real Audio. It also has the ugliest player going!</font></p>

        which are called by the player as needed, and can play as many as 8 different 
        files at the same time. If you want to really get into web sound, Beatnik
