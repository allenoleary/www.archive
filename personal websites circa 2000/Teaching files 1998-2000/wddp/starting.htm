      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Starting 
          a project is often the hardest thing to do, and the first steps can 
          make or break a project later on down the development track. How you 
          start will largely depend on your client and the scope of the project. 
          Often clients who 'know' most about the internet make the most incorrect 
          assumptions about what they want; it's your role as a designer/information 
          architect to get to grips with what they really want - you may surprise 
          them! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also it's 
          important to note that in all interactions with your clients you have 
          to talk at an appropriate level for their level of understanding, If 
          you can manage to be informative without being patronising, then you'll 
          have a much better change of them employing you again, or recommending 
          you to someone else.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This kind 
          of process also applies to any projects that you do for yourself: you 
          may find your initial assumptions need some adjustment after you treat 
          yourself like a client.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>So, what 
        do they really want?</b></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Usually 
          clients want 'a website for the company' or 'an information kiosk'. 
          All they are talking about here is what delivery medium they want, they 
          haven't told you anything at all about what the thing will do, how it 
          will help them or their customers, how it will be administered and run. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this 
          point you should get the client to take a step backwards, and start 
          asking the following sorts of questions (these are a selection from 
          'Elements of Web Design')</font></p>

          they've got all the content, only to give you a brochure and no copy 
          in a digital format. You should charge extra for conversions into digital

          maybe you need to call in a friend with database experience, or need 
          to go out and find access to an important piece of equipment you may

          you should check your assumptions with the client and then move forward 
          into the information design and architecture phase, utilising your module 
          making and linking skills to organise the content and pathways. You 
          will also need to consider any metaphors of design that you are using

          Playstation?) and how they will affect the information architecture.</font></p>

          are working through the questions of presentation, you will probably 
          be having ideas about how you want the project to look. You will need 
          to establish some guiding principles for 'look and feel' with the client 
          before you get too carried away. One way of ascertaining what a client 
          likes is to ask them if they have any favourite sites or titles they 
          like the look of, and get them to look at several site or titles that 
          will be in direct competition with your project. Ultimately this might 
          not be that important, but it will start them thinking about the look 
          they're after and the market they're trying to appeal to.</font></p>
