      There is a fourth major attractor, that of <b>`becoming'</b>, which has 
      it's own rich archaic and modern history. It's best modern theorist are 
      Deleuze and Guatarri. 
      <p> Briefly, this fourth attractor can be characterised as <b>the acceptance 
        of the process of `schziophrenia'</b> (here not meant in the clinical 
        sense of mental-illness). Deleuze and Guatarri's explication of `schizoanalysis' 
        in `Anti Oedipus makes it a break into the `unstable equilibrium' (plateau) 
        of continuing self-invention <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top"> 
    </td>
    <td valign="Bottom" bgcolor="#f5e7c2" width="150"><font size="-1">In `1000 
      plateaus' Deleuze and Guatarri go on to give examples of some becomings; 
      `One or Several Wolves?', `Becoming Intense, becoming-animal, becoming-imperceptible...', 
      and `Treatise on Nomadology' being the most influential among them. <br>

    <td><b>Playing with yourself.</b> 
      <p> While a lot of their theory is difficult to read, it also has a playful 
        and wicked sense about it; Deleuze himself describes his early program 
        of historical assessment; 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><cite>"What got me through that period was conceiving of the history 
          of philosophy as a kind of ass-fuck, or, what amounts to the same thing, 
          an immaculate conception. I imagined myself approaching the author from 
          behind and giving him a child that would indeed be his but would none 
          the less be monstrous."</cite> ( from `Negotiations') </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In the current context, one of their most important elaborations is that 
        of the `rhizome', which coincides almost exactly with my conception of 
        the network. <b>The rhizome is a `molecular' joining effect which stands 
        opposed to the arboreal hierarchy</b> which has dominated thought for 
        so long, and, aside from being very fashionable in academic circles (particularly 
        amongst the architectural, media and writing communities who seize it 
        for it's practical bent) achieves a degree of <b>embodiment in the distributed 
        networks of the computing world</b>, of which the internet is one. </p>

    <td><b>Becoming Virtual</b> 
      <p> However, to see the rhizome as merely a articulatory metaphor for analysing 
        the structure of the internet is superficial. <b>It also extends beyond 
        social or technical models and directly into issues of identity</b> <img src="goside.gif" width="75" height="19" border="0" align="top">&nbsp; 
        So we can meaningfully look at the relationship between the strange attractors; 
        one of identity creation, the other of `virtuality', which necessarily 
        leads us on to a further examination of <b>the nature of the computer 
        as a prosthesis,</b> and some political implications. In this construction 
        we are led to the concept of `becoming virtual' and it's contrary motion 
        `becoming real'. <br>

    <td valign="Bottom" bgcolor="#f5e7c2" width="150"><font size="-1">Deleuze 
      and Guatarri would draw no lines between the social, the technical and the 
      personal: all are `strata'. They would also approve of&nbsp;contingent uses 
      of their philosophy, describing it themselves as a toolkit.</font></td>
